The **Construction Site** is a building added in [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) "Back in the Saddle" update alongside the Birthday Event. The site is a relatively small structure with moderately good loot.

# Location and Spawning

Only one construction site can spawn per map. It consists of a bunker entrance (currently closed), a [Cooler](/obstacles/cooler), [Boxes](/obstacles/box), [Road Block](/obstacles/roadblock), barrels, a few [Sandbags](/obstacles/sandbags) and one [Flint Crate](/obstacles/crates).

# Tips

- Loot the Flint Crate first as it has the best loot in the building but be careful as another player might try to blow up the barrels instantly killing you. 
- The [Road Blocks](/obstacles/roadblock) and [Sandbags](/obstacles/sandbags) are good cover, but grenades can fly over them, forcing you out. 
- Use the [Bunker Entrance](/obstacles/bunker_entrance) for cover, as it is indestructible and has good positioning.
# Trivia

- The construction site was the first hint of a multi-story building in the game.
- One day, the bunker entrance may open, revealing a bunker...
