The **Golden Aegis Case** is an obstacle added in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) “High-Caliber Negotiations” update on September 22, 2024.

# Location & Spawning  

A Golden Aegis Case can always be found in the Secret Room on the second floor of the [AEGIS Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters). 

# Loot & More  

The Golden Aegis Case has a 66% chance to drop the [DEagle](/weapons/guns/deagle) and a 33% chance to drop the [RSh-12](/weapons/guns/rsh12). Both pistols have a 5% chance to spawn as the dual variant instead of the single. Additionally, the Golden Aegis Case can also very rarely drop a [G19](/weapons/guns/g19).

# Tips  

- Since this crate (almost) always gurantees a solid weapon, you should go for this crate first if you enter the Headquarters through the fire exit that leads directly to the second floor.
  - If it is already looted, be careful of any nearby players as both the DEagle and RSh-12 are deadly weapons that can kill you very quickly with their high DPS.

# Trivia

- It is unknown why "golden" and "aegis" are reversed in the idString of this obstacle.
