The **Ammo Crate** is an impenetrable [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.15.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.15.0) "Pulling the Pin" update on January 14th, 2024. It can only be destroyed using Airdrops or weapons with piercing damage.

# Location & Spawning

Three Ammo Crates spawn in the [Armory](/buildings/armory) in various locations around the structure. Two Ammo Crates spawn in the interior of each [Warehouse](/buildings/warehouse).

# Loot & More

Ammo Crates drop either 60 rounds of 5.56mm, 7.62mm, or 9mm or 10 rounds of 12 gauge. Ammo Crates can only be broken using weapons with piercing damage (such as a [Maul](/weapons/melee/maul)) or an [Airdrop](/obstacles/airdrops) landing on top of one.

# Tips

- Since Ammo Crates aren't easily destroyed, they make a great cover from enemies.
