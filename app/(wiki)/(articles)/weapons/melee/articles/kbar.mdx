The **USMC Mark 2 combat knife or Knife, Fighting Utility**, known in-game as the **K-Bar** is a melee weapon added in the v0.5.0 "Locked & Loaded" update on June 24, 2023.

# Background
The K-Bar is a combat knife designed by Union Cutlery, John M. Davis, and Howard E. America in 1942. It was adopted by the United States Marine Corps in 1942 and the US Navy in 1943. The knife has a 7-inch 1095 carbon steel clip point blade paired with a leather washer handle. The K-bar was used mainly by the U.S. Marines during World War II but it still sees use today as a general purpose knife.

# Strategies
## Using
- Try to get up close to your opponent without losing too much health, then spam left click when you are close enough to your opponent.
  - Beware if they have a gun designed for close range combat, such as the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues).
- Using any melee weapon requires good reaction time, as your opponent can escape your attack if they suddenly change directions.
## Countering
- If you see a player who has a K-Bar and is intrested in attacking you with it, stay at a distance and gun them down.
  - You can also attempt to rush in with a high-DPS close-range weapon or another melee weapon, although this is risky if the K-Bar user is skilled.

# Obtaning
The K-Bar can be obtained rarely from crates or other common loot sources. Additionally, it has a 75% chance of spawning in the melee crate that spawns once per map.

# Trivia
- The K-Bar is also known as the Ka-bar
- The name comes from a letter in 1923 received from a fur trapper who had used a knife he bought from Union Cutlery Co. to kill a wounded bear that was attacking him and his rifle was jammed. The partially legibile letter had the the phrase "ka bar" on it, as part of "kill a bear". The KA-BAR name was stamped onto many different knives, and Union Cutlery changed its name to Ka-Bar Cutlery Inc. in 1952
- The steel used in the K-bar has a hardness of 56-58 HRC
