The **Flint Stone** is an indestructible [Obstacle](/obstacles) added to the game in the [v0.10.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.10.0) "Back with a Bang" update on September 14th, 2023. It is destroyable with an airdrop or a weapon with piercing damage, but the flint stone drops good loot.

# Location & Spawning

Only one Flint Stone spawns per map, and it can be anywhere on the map. The Flint Stone is very difficult to see on the map due to its small size.

# Loot & More

One way to break the Flint Stone is to obtain a rare [Radio](/weapons/guns/radio) and use the summoned airdrop to destroy the Flint Stone. Technically, a naturally spawned airdrop can also break it, but this is exceedingly rare. You can also break the Flint Stone using a weapon with piercing damage, such as the [Maul](/weapons/melee/maul).
The Flint Stone has very good [loot](/loot#flint_stone), and always drops a [Gold Airdrop gun](/loot#gold_airdrop_guns).

# Tips

- The Flint Stone makes for a very good cover due to its indestructible nature.
- If you get a Radio, check the map to see if a Flint Stone is nearby that you can use on.

# Trivia

- Before [v0.13.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.13.0), the Flint Stone didn't drop any loot.
  - If the code was edited to make it destructible, it still wouldn't drop any loot.
- The name "Flint Stone" is a play on words that references the animated sitcom _The Flintstones_.
- As of [v0.14.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.14.0) the Flint Stone is the only obstacle the [Death Ray](/weapons/guns/deathray) does not penetrate through.
