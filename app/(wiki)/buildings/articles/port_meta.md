The **Port** is a very large structure added in the [v0.11.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.11.0) "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023. It has a number of buildings and containers and is also the home of the [Cargo Ship](/buildings/cargo_ship) and the [Oil Tanker](/buildings/oil_tanker).

# Location & Spawning

One Port attempts to spawn per map, always at the edge of the map. - Very rarely, a Port can fail to spawn on a map.

# Areas

## Ships

Main article: [Cargo Ship](/buildings/cargo_ship), [Oil Tanker](/buildings/oil_tanker).
On the outer edge of the Port, the Ships spawn in the water.

## Port Warehouses

Main article: [Port Warehouse](/buildings/port_warehouse).

## Port Shed

Main article: [Port Shed](/buildings/port_shed).
A Port Shed spawns towards the center of the Port, alongside a lowered [Barrier](/obstacles/barrier).

## Crane

Main article: [Crane](/buildings/crane).
A crane always spawns parallel to the Cargo Ship and contains a large amount of loot underneath it.

## Other

- The Port contains a large number of Containers in various locations. They are useful for getting some basic weapons, armor, and healing items to engage other players.
- In one of the corners opposite the Port Warehouses, there are multiple [Trucks](/obstacles/truck) and [Trailers](/obstacles/trailer), which make for effective cover.
- [Bollards](/obstacles/bollard) spawn along the border with the ocean.
- A line of [Porta Potties](/buildings/porta_potty) spawns near the trucks.
  - These are great for getting tons of healing items early in a game.

# Tips

- Be careful as there are often many players at the port looking for loot.
  - Unless you spawn close to the Port early-game, don't bother heading for the Port as it will likely already be looted by the time you arrive.
