The **Sickle** is a melee weapon added in the [v0.18.2](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.18.2) "Pulling the Pin" update on July 4th, 2024.

# Background

The khepesh, or the Sickle, is hypothesised to have developed from one of these, the epsilon axe (Terence Wise, Ancient Armies of the Middle East). There is evidence to suggest that it was introduced to Egypt by one of the Canaanite groups they had contact with.

# Strategies
- (TBA)
## Using

- The Sickle has a longer cooldown but the it is easer to use.
 - Make sure to time your shots well, as missing one can be damaging.
 - Think of the Sickle as a buffed [Baseball Bat](/weapons/melee/baseball_bat).

## Countering

- As with all melee weapons, the best way to avoid them entirely is to keep your distance and use a gun designed for mid or long-range combat to kill them.
 - Use a high-DPS weapon like the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues) to shoot down the Sickle user approaching you if you can't escape.

# Obtaining

The sickle can be obtained from melee crates (/obstacles/melee_crate) and airdrops (/obstacles/airdrops)
