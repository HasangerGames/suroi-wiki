The **Firework Launcher** is an RPG utilizing firework ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.18.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.18.0) "Back in the Saddle" update on July 8th, 2024. It shoots very slow, but has a high spread and damage. 

# Strategies

## Using

- The Firework Launcher is viable throughout the game due to its versatility.
  - The [Firework Warehouse](/buildings/firework_warehouse) is intensely contested in the beginning of the game as it contains the Firework Launcher, Fireworks, and [Confetti Grenades](/weapons/throwables/confetti_grenade).
  - Do not enter the building unless you spawn early into the match or are adequately equipped.
- Make sure to pick up as much Firework ammunition as you can, as it will be difficult to obtain more later in the game.
  - If you are running low on Fireworks, you can break [Ammo Crates](/obstacles/ammo_crate) using a [Maul](/weapons/melee/maul) to get extra fireworks.
- The Firework Launcher is most effective in long range fights.
  - It pairs very well with larger scopes, like the 8x and 15x.
- The Fireworks shot out of the Firework Launcher move relatively slow, so make sure to lead your shots when firing at opponents.
- You can easily damage yourself with the Firework Launcher, so make sure that there are no obstructions in the firing path.

## Countering

- Weapons such as shotguns or other SMGs overpower the Firework Launcher at close range.
- Stay at close range, because the Firework Launcher is not very good at CQC (Close Quarters Combat).
- Fireworks move slowly; if you are fired upon, you have a window of time to dodge the firework, even at close range.
  - As a result, most players lead their shots when using the Firework Launcher: use this to your advantage.

# Obtaining

- The Firework Launcher is one of the rarest weapons in the game: it has a singular spawn location that with only one found in every match. It can be found in the [Firework Warehouse](/buildings/firework_warehouse) with ammo. The Firework Launcher is only obtainable during the Anniversary and Fourth of July events.
  - In 2024, the Fourth of July event coincided with the 20k Discord member milestone.
