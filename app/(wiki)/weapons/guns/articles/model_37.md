The **Ithaca Model 37**, also known as the **Ithaca 37** and known in-game as the **Model 37** is a pump-action shotgun utilizing 12-gauge ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.4.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.4.0) "Supplies received" update on June 17th, 2023. It has high damage, but short range and lots of recoil.

# Background

After the shotgun was proven to be an effective weapon in WW1, demand for them skyrocketed post-war. Ithaca Gun Company aimed to introduce a competitor to the venerable Winchester 1912 (which was in itself based on the Winchester Model 1893/97). The new gun was based on the Remington Model 17, with some tweaks done to make it more reliable, easier and cheaper to produce. They did this while waiting for the patents to expire on the Remington Model 17. Initially, the gun was going to be released in 1933 as the Ithaca Model 33, but the company discovered that they had missed some patents by the Model 17's designer, John Pederson. Upon these patents expiring in 1937, the shotgun was released. It was not very successful initially, as the war was imminent and consumers did not have much money to spend. Although production has been paused several times, the Model 37 is still in production and holds the record for the longest production run of a pump-action shotgun.

# Strategies

## Using

- Use quickswitching to avoid the slowdown applied when firing the Model 37. This will greatly increase your mobility and make you less of an easy target.
- Dual Model 37s are one of the most powerful combinations in the game. You can also pair the Model 37 with another shotgun such as a [M3K](/weapons/guns/m3k) or [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues) to achieve a similar effect.
- The Model 37 is extremely effective in confined spaces such as [Buildings](/obstacles/buildings).
  - If a player is in a Container, firing a shot at the player will result in nearly all of the pellets ricocheting inside and hitting the player.
- You can also quickswitch the Model 37 with a sniper, to cover both short-range and long-range combat.

## Countering

- As a shotgun, the Model 37 has a fairly short range compared to most guns. Knowing this, you can avoid being hit by using an SMG like the [MP40](/weapons/guns/mp40) or any assault rifle from a distance.
- Be wary of confined spaces such as Buildings and Containers, as they are where the Model 37 is strongest.
- The [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues) has a higher DPS than the Model 37, provided you hit both shots.

# Obtaining

The Model 37 is fairly common as both ground loot as well as in places such as [Regular Crates](/obstacles/regular_crate).

# Trivia

- The reference image for the in-game Model 37 is based on a "Trench" variant of the Model 37, complete with a bayonet mount.
- The Model 37 ejects spent shells directly downwards.
  - This is intended to make the shotgun more reliable by keeping out things that could foul it like dirt, dust, and water.
