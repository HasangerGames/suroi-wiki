The Lewis gun (aka Lewis automatic machine gun or Lewis automatic rifle), known in-game as the Lewis Gun, is an LMG utilizing 7.62mm ammunition.

# Background

The Lewis gun was invented in 1911 by Isaac Newton Lewis, a U.S. Army colonel. It was widely used by the United Kingdom during the First World War. During the Second World War, old stores of Lewis guns supplemented the arsenal of the Allies. It saw use both as a LMG and a mounted weapon for boats, airplanes, and vehicles. It was withdrawn from service in the UK in 1946. Learn more about the Lewis Gun [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_gun).

# Strategies

## Using

- The Lewis Gun is a great weapon for clearing out obstacles, so don't be afraid to use it to destroy enemy cover.
- Due to its long reload time, it is important to reload this weapon whenever you have the chance. You should also make sure to take cover when reloading, as you are vulnerable.
- Make sure to pick up some additional ammunition for this weapon, as it only spawns with 2 magazines' worth. This is especially important if you plan on using it to destroy obstacles.
- Like other LMGs, it is important to pair this gun up with a secondary weapon that can be used in close quarters. The Lewis Gun is not very effective at close range and may leave you vulnerable if your opponent decides to rush you.
  - Conversely, the Lewis Gun is fairly effective at long range, so try to keep your distance from enemies.
  - It is inadvisable to use this weapon within [Buildings](/buildings) and tight spaces, where you can easily be rushed or ambushed.

## Countering

- Make sure to have a short-range, high DPS weapon ready, as the Lewis Gun performs poorly in close quarters.
  - Good choices include the [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi), [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues) or [HP18](/weapons/guns/hp18)
- As the Lewis Gun can easily shred basic cover such as [Trees](/obstacles/tree) or [Rocks](/obstacles/rock), take cover behind indestructible objects such as Buildings or Containers.
  - Keep in mind, however, that the bullets spent on destroying your cover are bullets that aren't hitting you, so these forms of cover are still useful.
- Stay away from explosive [Barrels](/obstacles/barrel) as the Lewis Gun can pop them extremely quickly and without warning.
- Try to lure the player closer to you, as the Lewis Gun is not very effective at close range.
- If you decide to rush the enemy, keep in mind they might have a secondary high DPS weapon.

# Obtaining

The Lewis Gun can be rarely found as world loot, but it is more common in higher-tier places such as [Flint](/obstacles/flint_crate) and [AEGIS Crates](/obstacles/aegis_crate).

# Trivia

- Most Lewis Guns in real life were chambered for .303 British or .30-06 Springfield
  - This means the Lewis Gun in-game is most likely a 7.62x54R variant exported to Russia in 1917
- The Lewis Gun is the first LMG to be added to the game
