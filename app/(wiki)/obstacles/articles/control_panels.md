**Control Panels** are a type of explosive obstacle first added in the [v0.11.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.11.0) "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023, which introduced three variants of the Control Panel. A fourth variant of the Control Panel was later added in update v0.16.0 "A Sailor's Dream" on February 26th, 2024. They come in four distinct variants. 

# Location & Spawning

## Control Panel 1

One Control Panel 1 spawns in the Cabin of the [Oil Tanker](/buildings/oil_tanker). In the Oil Tanker, it can be interacted with to open the [Vault Door](/obstacles/doors), which allows access to the [Briefcase](/obstacles/briefcase).

## Control Panel 2

One Control Panel 2 spawns in the Captain's Cabin of the [Cargo Ship](/buildings/cargo_ship) and in the vault of the [Armory](/buildings/armory). Unlike the Control Panel, the Control Panel 2 cannot be interacted with.

## Small Control Panel

One Small Control panel spawns in the Captain's Cabin of the [Cargo Ship](/buildings/cargo_ship). Two Small Control Panels spawn in the Interior of the [Sea Traffic Control](/buildings/sea_traffic_control).

## Tugboat Control Panel

One Tugboat Control Panel spawns in the Cabin in all types of [Tugboats](/buildings/tugboats) and [Cargo Ships](buildings/cargo_ship).

# Loot & More

Control Panels don't drop loot when destroyed, but it will create an explosion that will damage players and obstacles nearby.

# Tips

- Since Control Panels are explosive, you can shoot them if they're on low health to make it explode. The bullets from shooting and the shrapnel may damage your enemy, giving you an advantage.
