The **Daewoo Precision Industries USAS-12**, known in-game as the **USAS-12**, is a powerful automatic shotgun firing explosive 12 Gauge ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.12.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.12.0) "Trick-or-Tweak" update on October 29th, 2023.

# Background

The USAS-12 was designed in 1989 by John Trevor Jr. and was based on previous automatic shotguns such as the AA-12. It was mass-produced by Daewoo Precision Industries starting in the early 1990s. The shotgun saw very limited success in the civilian market due to heavy restrictions. However, it sold well for use in private security forces and special forces in South American and Asian countries.

# Strategies

## Using

- The USAS-12 is very powerful in close to mid-range combat due to its high DPS and explosive rounds.
  - Try and force your opponent to get close by taking cover against longer-range weapons in a [Building](/buildings) or behind indestructible objects.
- The explosion and shrapnel have a high obstacle multiplier. Use this to shred cover such as [Tree](/obstacles/tree) and [Rocks](/obstacles/rock).
  - Being splash damage, it can "go around" obstacles; in other words, you don't need to have a line of sight with your opponent to damage them. This is very powerful.
- Be careful not to accidentally damage yourself when using the USAS-12 at close range.
- The USAS-12 has a slow bullet speed, so you will need to lead your shots when firing at moving targets.

## Countering

- Close-range weapons such as the [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi) and shotguns are ineffective against a USAS-12's high DPS.
- Use longer-range weapons such as accurate assault rifles, DMRs, and sniper rifles.
- Try and maintain high adrenaline, as it can help you dodge some of the USAS-12 shots.
- Be wary of Buildings, as they can be a death trap against a USAS-12 user.

# Obtaining
The USAS-12 can be found in Harvest Mode in a [Briefcase](/obstacles/briefcase), as well as very rarely in the [Loot Tree](/obstacles/loot_tree). It can also be found in Harvest Mode [Gold Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops).

It was also obtainable during 2 previous events:
- On the Halloween 2023 map, it had a 5% chance to drop from a [Pumpkins](/obstacles/pumpkin).
- The USAS-12 was also rarely acquired during the Suroi Weapon Swap Event upon killing another player with any gun.

# Trivia

- USAS-12 stands for "Universal Sporting Automatic Shotgun 12 gauge".
- In Suroi, the USAS-12 fires FRAG-12 ammunition.
  - FRAG-12 is a specialized 12-gauge shell that contains a small amount of high-explosive.
  - The [M590M](/weapons/guns/m590m) also fires FRAG-12.
- The USAS-12 is one of 7 guns that were in surviv.io, the others being the [Vector](/weapons/guns/vector), [AK-47](/weapons/guns/ak47), [VSS](/weapons/guns/vss), [M1 Garand](/weapons/guns/m1_garand), [DEagle](/weapons/guns/deagle), and [Mosin-Nagant](/weapons/guns/mosin_nagant).
