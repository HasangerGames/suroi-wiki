# Developing

Thank you for considering to contribute code to the wiki!

We use the following tech stack for the wiki,

- NextJS
- React
- TailwindCSS
- Typescript

Please refer to the documentation of each framework/library for more information

## Getting started

We use git submodules, so first time setup for a development environment is slightly different from normal,

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hasangergames/suroi-wiki.git
git submodule init
git submodule update --remote
cd suroi-wiki

pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

Note that we use `pnpm`, instead of `npm` (because it is just better)

## Recommended setup

- Visual Studio Code/VSCodium
- VSCode Extensions (VSCode should automatically recommend you workspace extensions)
  - Typescript
  - ESLint
  - Prettier
  - Code Spell Checker
  - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- PNPM
- Git with SSH (optional)

(We obviously don't care about what you use)

### Setting up a git hook

If you have been mad at GitHub's email spam telling you about failed CI runs, try out Git hooks!

At the project root,

```sh
echo "pnpm ci:lint\npnpm spellcheck" > .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Now Git will lint and spellcheck for you before you commit your changes!

## Do and Don't

**Don't use `<a></a>` and `<img />`**

We use the NextJS component equivalents, `<Link></Link>` and `<Image />`

**Don't push large amounts of changes to the wiki code**

Make a branch/fork and create a pull request please. Also have at **least one** maintainer review your code. Small changes are fine and don't need review (though it is best to get approval)

**Don't ignore the JSX key error**

It's super annoying, but add a `key` prop anyways

**Don't push hacky solutions**

The only exception is if it will get refactored soon after anyway or if another person is willing to refactor it.

**Don't use external images**

Only exception (currently) is GitHub for game assets and Invidious for YouTube thumbnails, please put your images in `/public`

**Don't use emojis in commit messages**

Or you will get publically shamed.

**Do use tree shaking**

If you are adding new libraries, please use tree shaking when possible, to keep bundle sizes minimal

**Do use a formatter and linter**

Run this command to run ESLint and Prettier

```sh
pnpm lint
```

**Do use a spellchecker**

Just run this command to spellcheck

```sh
pnpm spellcheck
```

<GenericNotice emote="bleh">
  Note that we run GitHub CI jobs to check for linting, formatting and
  spellchecking!
</GenericNotice>

**TLDR**: It is best to ask the wiki maintainers (**Compositr** and **Kenos**) if you should contribute something to the wiki
