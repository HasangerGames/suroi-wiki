The **Винтовка Снайперская Специальная Крупнокалиберная "Выхлоп" ("Special High-Caliber Sniper Rifle "Exhaust")**, known in-game as the **VKS Vykhlop** or simply the **VKS**, is a suppressed sniper rifle utilizing the .50 Cal ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024.

# Background
The VKS was designed by Центральное конструкторско-исследовательское бюро спортивного и охотничьего оружия (Central Design and Research Bureau of Sporting and Hunting Arms), also known as ЦКИБ СОО (CKIB SOO), in the early 2000s for use in special operations requiring a silencer. It is intended to replace the aging VSS sniper rifle, which suffered from a lack of penetration against modern body armor. It is extremely accurate and can penetrate 16mm of steel at 200 meters or GOST 5 body armor at 100 meters when using a high penetration STs-130VPS cartridge.

# Strategies
## Using
- Take advantage of the high accuracy and damage and snipe enemies from a distance.
  - If you are skilled enough, it can be used at close range, though this can be dangerous if your opponent possesses a high-DPS weapon such as a shotgun.
- Keep your distance by running away while shooting + quickswitching if your opponent decides to rush.
  - Make sure to quickswitch as the speed reduction after a shot can be just enough time for your opponent to gun you down and kill you.
- Don't be overconfident. While it may seem that you are unstoppable with such a powerful weapon, enemies can still catch you by surprise.
- As with other weapons that use rare ammunition, try to conserve ammo.

## Countering
- Don't rush your opponent directly if you plan on attacking close-range, as it makes you an easy shot. Instead, strategically move around obstacles and strafe in open spaces to minimize the number of shots your opponent hits and waste their ammo.
    - High adrenaline makes strafing more effective.
- If you have another sniper rifle such as the [Mosin-Nagant](/weapons/guns/mosin_nagant), it can be used for a long-range fight between you and your opponent. Be aware that the VKS deals a lot of damage, so hide behind [Obstacles](/obstacles) and strafe whenever possible.
- One weakness the VKS has is against high damaging shotguns in close quarters combat. The shotgun's higher damage output makes it a better choice for close-up fighting.
  - Dual [Model 37s](/weapons/guns/model_37) or a [Vepr-12](/weapons/guns/vepr12) are among the best for this.
- Hide behind indestructible cover such as [Oil Tanks](/obstacles/oil_tank) or [Sandbags](/obstacles/sandbags). The .50 Cal ammo that the VKS uses is rare, so you may be able to make your opponent run out of it by wasting it.

# Obtaining
The VKS can be found rarely in [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrop_crate), very rarely in [River Chests](/obstacles/river_chest) and [Viking Chests](/obstacles/viking_chest), and extremely rarely as world loot in basic loot sources such as [Regular Crates](/obstacles/regular_crate).

# Trivia
- In real-life, the VKS uses the same 12.7x55mm cartridge as the [RSh-12](/weapons/guns/rsh12) and ShAK-12.
