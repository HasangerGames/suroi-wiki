The **Container** is a building added in the [v0.11.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.11.0) "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023. 

# Location & Spawning

Up to twelve Containers spawn in random positions on the map. Many Containers can also spawn as part of the [Port](/buildings/port) structure.

# Loot & More

Containers always contain one ground loot item on its floor.

# Tips
- The outside or inside of the Container is great for cover because the Container has indestructible walls.
- The Container, being made out of metal, reflects bullets.
  - You can use this to damage opponents behind cover.
- You can also hide inside containers and kill unsuspecting players with a high-DPS weapon like the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues).
  - Make sure your container doesn't have a hole at the top, as your opponent can see you through the hole.
- If you see a player inside a Container with one exit, you can fire bullets into the Container with a high-DPS weapon. Your opponent won't be able to see you because they have their scopes disabled when inside a Container.
  - This usually kills your opponent because the interior of a Container also reflects bullets, making them harder to dodge.
  - However, don't get too close, as your opponent could rush you.
    - You can also be hit by your own bullets.
# Trivia

- The Containers were designed by platonthek.
