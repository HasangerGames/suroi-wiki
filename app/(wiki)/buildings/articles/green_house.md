# Green House

The Green House is a building added in the [v0.17.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.17.0) "Just the Two of Us" update on March 31st, 2024. It drops decent loot, especially with the recent buff of the [HP-18](/weapons/guns/hp18).
# Location & Spawning

In most maps, 2-4 Green Houses spawn, though that number can vary. Often, players spawn somewhat close to a Green House, and the guaranteed weapon drop makes it an attractive location. 
# Loot & More
The Green House has an [HP-18](/weapons/guns/hp18) Gun Mount next to the front entrance. It also has a few [Large Drawers](/obstacles/large_drawer) and a [Bookshelf](/obstacles/bookshelf). Both of these have a somewhat high chance to drop a gun, so break these first so you can go into battle. 
# Tips

- When coming in through the main entrance, loot the [HP-18 Gun Mount](/obstacles/gun_mount_hp18) first so you can kill other players if they come in. 
- [Potted Plants](/obstacles/potted_plant) drop ammo, heal, and sometimes equipment, but not guns.
- This is one of the more loot-dense houses in the game, so if you spawn late, it will likely be already looted by other players. 
- Use the skylights and partially damaged roof to check if there are players inside, but be careful because they may be able to see you as well. 
- The covered entrance in the front of the house can be used to ambush players with as you are hidden from the other players' view. The [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues) or [Model 37](/weapons/guns/model_37) are good options for this. The [HP-18](/weapons/guns/hp18) that can be found from the Gun Mount is also a reliable option.
  - Note that your opponent might creep up to you from the side with another high-DPS weapon, so this is not a free-kill strategy.
# Trivia

 - This is the biggest house currently in the game.
 - In v0.11.0, the [TV](/obstacles/tv) and [Washing Machine](/obstacles/washing_machine) were removed. However, six versions later, they were readded. In fact, Hasanger, the owner of suroi.io foreshadowed this, saying "The big variant will be overhauled and re-added in a future update", refering to the Green House.
