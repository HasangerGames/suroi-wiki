The **Tactical Pack** is a piece of [Equipment](/equipment) added in the [v0.7.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.7.0) "Geared Up" update on July 10, 2023. It is the third and final backpack tier (not including the [Bag](/equipment/backpacks/bag)) and can fit much more amounts of ammo, healing items, and throwables compared to the other backpacks.

# Obtaining

The Tactical Pack can be obtained rarely from common loot sources such as [crates](/obstacles/crates), but it is most easily found from an [Airdrop](/obstacles/airdrops) because they have a guaranteed chance to drop one piece of level 3 equipment. 

# Trivia 

 - The Tactical Pack has an AEGIS logo on it.
