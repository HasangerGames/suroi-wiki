The **Lewis Automatic Machine Gun** or **Lewis Automatic Rifle**, known in-game as the **Lewis Gun**, is an LMG utilizing 7.62mm ammunition that was added to the game in the [v0.5.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.5.0) "Locked & Loaded" update on June 24th, 2023.

# Background

The Lewis gun was invented in 1911 by Isaac Newton Lewis, a U.S. Army colonel. It was widely used by the United Kingdom during the First World War. During the Second World War, old stores of Lewis guns supplemented the arsenal of the Allies where it saw use both as an LMG and as a mounted weapon for boats, airplanes, and vehicles. It was withdrawn from service in the UK in 1946 after being replaced by the Bren gun in the infantry and by the Vickers K machine gun as a mounted weapon but was still used in conflicts after the Second World War such as the Korean and Vietnam wars mostly by other members of the United nations.

# Strategies

## Using

- The Lewis Gun is a great weapon for clearing out obstacles, so don't be afraid to use it to destroy enemy cover.
- Due to its long reload time, it is important to reload this weapon whenever you have the chance. You should also make sure to take cover when reloading, as you are vulnerable.
- Make sure to pick up some additional ammunition for this weapon, as it only spawns with 2 magazines' worth. This is especially important if you plan on using it to destroy obstacles.
- Like other LMGs, it is important to pair this gun up with a secondary weapon that can be used in close quarters. The Lewis Gun is not very effective at close range due to having lower DPS than other weapons of similar rarity like the [ARX-160](/weapons/guns/arx160) and may leave you vulnerable if your opponent decides to rush you.
  - Conversely, the Lewis Gun is fairly effective at mid to long range due to the high bullet speed, decent accuracy, and damage, so try to keep your distance from enemies.
  - It is inadvisable to use this weapon within [Buildings](/buildings) and tight spaces, where you can easily be rushed or ambushed.

## Countering

- Make sure to have a short-range, high DPS weapon ready, as the Lewis Gun performs poorly in close quarters.
  - Good choices include the [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi), [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues) or [HP18](/weapons/guns/hp18)
- As the Lewis Gun can easily shred basic cover such as [Trees](/obstacles/tree) or [Rocks](/obstacles/rock), take cover behind indestructible objects such as Buildings or Containers when possible.
  - Keep in mind, however, that the bullets spent on destroying your cover are bullets that aren't hitting you, so these forms of cover are still useful.
- Stay away from explosive [Barrels](/obstacles/barrel) as the Lewis Gun can pop them extremely quickly and without warning.
- Try to lure the player closer to you, as the Lewis Gun is not very effective at close range.
  - If your opponent notices what you are doing and keeps their distance, use a weapon with high accuracy and DPS to counter the Lewis Gun user. The [MCX Spear](/weapons/guns/mcx_spear) is especially effective at this because it has much higher DPS than the Lewis Gun and higher accuracy, which can be very helpful since the Lewis Gun has high recoil.
- If you decide to rush the enemy, keep in mind they might have a secondary high DPS weapon.


# Obtaining

The Lewis Gun can be rarely found as world loot, but it is more common in higher-tier places such as [Flint](/obstacles/flint_crate) and [AEGIS Crates](/obstacles/aegis_crate).

# Trivia

- Most Lewis guns in real life were chambered for .303 British or .30-06 Springfield. Lewis guns exported to Russia were chambered in 7.62x54mmR.
  - The variant in-game is chambered in .30-06 Springfield which in metric is 7.62×63mm.
  - The [M1 Garand](/weapons/guns/m1_garand) is also chambered in .30-06 Springfield.
- The Lewis Gun is the first LMG added to the game.
