The **Barrett M95** also called the **Barrett**, is a powerful bolt-action sniper utilizing 12.7mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.13.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.13.0) "Terminal Velocity" update on November 27th, 2023. It has very high damage, but a slow fire rate and high recoil.

# Background

The Barrett M95 is a redesigned version of the Barrett M90, which was itself a bullpup bolt-action version of the semi-automatic Barrett M82. Compared to the M90, the M95 is the adjustment of the pistol grip and trigger to gain better magazine clearance. Minor changes were also made, such as a chrome-plated barrel, a redesigned bolt handle, and a modified firing pin and trigger. The Barrett M82 was chosen over the M95 to become the US Army's new anti-materiel rifle, but it still sees usage in the hands of a variety of special forces worldwide.

# Strategies

## Using

- The Barrett only spawns with 20 rounds of 12.7mm ammunition, so conserve your ammo and don't waste your shots.
- Try and get your opponent to slow themselves down in some way because it makes hitting your shots easier.
  - You can do this when your opponent is in water, shooting, or using a [Healing Item](/healing) (or any combination).
  - The best target is a player who is standing still (you may want to conserve your ammo, though).
- The Barrett works both close-range and long-range due to its high damage output.
  - Pair it with another high-damaging weapon, such as another sniper or a shotgun, to shred players.
- Always quickswitch the Barrett, as it has a lot of recoils as well as a long recoil time.
- Be careful, as the unique bullet trail of 12.7 ammunition will give away what gun you have and might lead players to target you.
  - This can be useful for getting high kills if you are skilled enough.
- If you find a Barrett but have little to no ammunition, it probably isn't worth picking up, since your chance of coming across more ammo is next to nothing.
  - You could, however, try and use it to bait other players into an ambush.
- Despite having a 1x obstacle multiplier, the Barrett is still somewhat capable of destroying cover.
  - This isn't a good idea, though, because of the very rare ammo.
  - If the opponent is near a [Barrel](/obstacles/barrel) or [Super Barrel](/obstacles/super_barrel) that is low on health and smoking, you can shoot it to do extra damage (though probably not as much as actually hitting them with the Barrett).
- Use LMGs such as the [Stoner 63](/weapons/guns/stoner_63) to destroy cover at long range, and then pick off players with Barrett.
  - You can also use assault rifles to weaken your opponent and then finish them off with the Barrett.
- By hiding in a [Bush](/obstacles/bush) and camping, you can surprise your opponents and kill them before they can react.
- If you ever run low on 12.7 ammo, you can break [Ammo Crates](/obstacles/ammo_crate) using a [Maul](/weapons/melee/maul) to get extra ammo.

## Countering

- Use lots of adrenaline to move faster, strafe, and get the Barrett user to miss their bullets. This also wastes their ammunition.
- You can use cover to pretend to move out and get your opponent to shoot, but then move back and have the shot miss you.
- Although the Barrett does a lot of damage, it usually isn't an instant kill, especially in the late game when you likely have high-tier [Armor](/equipment/armor).
- Watch out if you are at 8x or 15x range because the Barrett has a very fast bullet velocity.
- The Barrett can be unwieldy in CQC (Close Quarters Combat) due to its long barrel. Try using a high DPS weapon like a SMG or a shotgun. Weapons with short barrels, like the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues) work best for this.
- Other powerful snipers, like the [Tango 51](/weapons/guns/tango_51), while not as good as the Barrett, can still pack quite a punch against an opponent (especially in dual form).
- Powerful shotgun combos like dual [Model 37s](/weapons/guns/model_37) can sometimes overpower the Barrett at close-range.

# Obtaining

- The only way to get the Barrett is to either find one in a [Gold Airdrop](/obstacles/gold_airdrop_crate) or by breaking a [Flint Stone](/obstacles/flint_stone).

# Trivia

- The Barrett is the second bullpup weapon to be added to Suroi, after the [AUG](/weapons/guns/aug)
- At 129 damage, the Barrett has the highest damage per bullet of any obtainable weapon
- In real life, the Barrett uses the .50 BMG cartridge
  - However, this is simplified to the 12.7mm ammunition (technically correct because .50 BMG is 12.7x99mm)
- The Barrett has the fastest bullet speed of any gun (excluding the [Death Ray](/weapons/guns/death_ray))
