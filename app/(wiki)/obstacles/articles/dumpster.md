Dumpsters can drop guns, healing items, scopes, and equipment.

# Tips

- Dumpsters can drop decent loot, although most people don't break them because of its' high health.
  - If crates or other loot are nearby, you should use those instead.
  - Conversely, if there isn't loot nearby, breaking a dumpster can give you helpful loot.
- Dumpsters reflect bullets, so you can use this to ricochet bullets towards enemies.
