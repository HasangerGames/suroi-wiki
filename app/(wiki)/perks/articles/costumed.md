**Costumed** is a [Perk](/perks) added in the [v0.21.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.21.0) "Plumpkin Panic" update on October 31st, 2024. It disguises a player as a random obstacle.

# Effects
- Disguises a player as an obstacle, which can be one of the following: 
  - Any tree variant (except for the [Small Oak Tree](/obstacles/small_oak_tree) for unknown reasons)
  - [Stump](/obstacles/stump)
  - [Rock](/obstacles/rock)
  - [Regular Crate](/obstacles/regular_crate)
  - [Barrel](/obstacles/barrel) or [Super Barrel](/obstacles/super_barrel)
  - [Vibrant Bush](/obstacles/vibrant_bush)
  - [Oak Leaf Pile](/obstacles/oak_leaf_pile)
  - [Hay Bale](/obstacles/hay_bale)
  - [Baby Plumpkin](/obstacles/baby_plumpkin), [Plumpkin](/obstacles/plumpkin), or [Diseased Plumpkin](/obstacles/diseased_plumpkin) (very rarely)

# Obtaining
Costumed can be obtained from [Plumpkin Gamble](/perks/lets_go_gambling) which drops from [Diseased Plumpkins](/obstacles/diseased_plumpkin). Unlike all other perks that can be rolled to from the Plumpkin Gamble perk, the Costumed perk can also be obtained with a 40% chance from [Jack O' Lanterns](/obstacles/jack_o_lantern).

# Strategies
## Using
- Depending on which obstacle you swap to, you might be able to hide out in the open just by standing still.
- However, this perk can also make you much easier to spot, espscially if the obstacle you swapped to is a large one like a [Maple Tree](/obstacles/maple_tree). Depending on the situation or your playstyle, this may be a good or bad thing.

## Countering
- Sometimes the obstacle that the player is disguised as can make it hard to aim properly. Try your best to aim at the center of the disguised player.
