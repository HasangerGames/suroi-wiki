**Second Wind** is a [Perk](/perks) added in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. It grants a speed boost when below 50% health.

# Effects
When below 50% health:
- 40% Speed increase

# Obtaining
In Harvest Mode, Second Wind drops from the [Plumpkin](/obstacles/plumpkin), located in the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta). It is also rarely dropped from [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops) and [Gold Airdrops](/obstacles/gold_airdrop_crate).

# Strategies
## Using
- Generally, it's not a good idea to intentionally dip below 50% health to activate the perk, as this leaves you vulnerable.
- Second Wind is very useful for escaping the Gas in the later stages of the game if you get caught in it and start taking a lot of damage.
- Make sure to move around in random directions and strafe your opponents to benefit the most from Second Wind.
- You can also use Second Wind to escape from a fight quickly if you decide you might be killed/knocked out.

## Countering
- Use a long ranged weapon such as a sniper or DMR to keep damaging any player with Second Wind that tries to run away.
- Be aware that if the perk is active, that means they only have half their health and will be easier to kill if you can hit them.
- Use [Frag Grenades](/weapons/throwables/frag_grenade) or explosive shotguns like the [USAS-12](/weapons/guns/usas12) or [M590M](/weapons/guns/m590m), as the area damage can be more effective at dealing with highly mobile Second Wind users.
- If in a Duo or Squad, have everyone use weapons like DMRs to spray the opponent with Second Wind, since enough bullets should hit to incapacitate them.
