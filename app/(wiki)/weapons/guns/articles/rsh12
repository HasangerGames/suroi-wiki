The **Револьвер Штурмовой калибра 12,7 (Assault Revolver Calibre 12.7)**, known in-game as the **Rsh-12**, is a pistol utilizing the .50 Cal ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) "High Caliber Negotiations" update on September 22nd, 2024. The Rsh-12 features a very low magazine size, but extreme damage.

# Background
The Rsh-12 was created for Russian Federal Security Service for use in high-stakes operations. Designed by Viktor Zelenko of the KPB Instrument Design Bureau, it fires the 12.7x55mm cartridge also used by the VKS sniper rifle and ShAk-12 battle rifle. Unlike most pistols, it fires from the bottom chamber rather than the top. The RSh-12 features a gas system that is purported to be similar to that of the [M1895](/weapons/guns/m1895), and has support for a flashlight, supressor, foregrip, buttstock. Not much is know about if the RSh-12 ever entered production, and if it was ever used. In real life, the large caliber is most likely best suited for anti-material purposes in a close-quarters situation, such as shooting door locks.
