**Pan Stoves** are a type of [Obstacle](/obstacles) in suroi. Both the Normal and Small Pan Stove's were added, along with the [Pan](/weapons/melee/pan) in the [v0.23.1](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.23.1) update on January 27th, 2025

# Location & Spawning

The Pan Stove has a 3% chance to spawn instead of their other variant, [Small & Normal Stove](/obstacles/stoves). They may spawn in residential buildings such as the [Green House](/buildings/green_house) and [Mobile Home](/buildings/mobile_home).

# Loot & More

All types of Stoves reflect bullets, drops the [Pan](/weapons/melee/pan), and always explode upon being broken, dealing heavy damage to nearby players and obstacles.

# Tips

- If you see a Pan stove, hit it a few times. Until you see smoke, then with a gun shoot it, to minimize how much ammo you use.
- If another player is near a Pan Stove inside of a building, you can shoot at the Pan Stove with an assault rifle or LMG to explode it and damage or kill the player.
- The Small Pan Stove inside of the Mobile Home is particularly dangerous as the Mobile Home is a very cramped building which leaves little room for you to escape the explosion of the Small Pan Stove if an enemy begins shooting it down, especially due to the relatively low health of Pan Stoves.

# Trivia

- The explosion of the Pan Stove has the same stats as a [Barrel](/obstacles/barrel).
- The Stoves in Suroi are most likely gas stoves as they explode upon being broken. This also means that the gas used to power the stove is probably stored directly inside of the Stove. Shooting the stove with a gun would cause the gas to leak out and potentially ignite, causing a large explosion.
