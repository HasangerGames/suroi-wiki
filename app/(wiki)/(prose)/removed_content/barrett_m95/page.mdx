# Barrett M95

The **Barrett M95** also called the **Barrett**, is a powerful bolt-action sniper utilizing 12.7mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.13.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.13.0) "Terminal Velocity" update on November 27th, 2023 and removed in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) "High Caliber Negotiations" update on September 22nd, 2024 after being replaced by the [L115A1](/weapons/guns/l115a1). It has very high damage, but a slow fire rate and high recoil.

# Background

The Barrett M95 is a redesigned version of the Barrett M90, which was itself a bullpup bolt-action version of the semi-automatic Barrett M82. Compared to the M90, the M95 is the adjustment of the pistol grip and trigger to gain better magazine clearance. Minor changes were also made, such as a chrome-plated barrel, a redesigned bolt handle, and a modified firing pin and trigger. The Barrett M82 was chosen over the M95 to become the US Army's new anti-materiel rifle, but it still sees usage in the hands of a variety of special forces worldwide.

# Strategies

## Using

- The Barrett only spawns with 20 rounds of 12.7mm ammunition, so conserve your ammo and don't waste your shots.
- Try and get your opponent to slow themselves down in some way because it makes hitting your shots easier.
  - You can do this when your opponent is in water, shooting, or using a [Healing Item](/healing) (or any combination).
  - The best target is a player who is standing still (you may want to conserve your ammo, though).
- The Barrett works both close-range and long-range due to its high damage output.
  - Pair it with another high-damaging weapon, such as another sniper or a shotgun, to shred players.
- Always quickswitch the Barrett, as it has a lot of recoils as well as a long recoil time.
- Be careful, as the unique bullet trail of 12.7 ammunition will give away what gun you have and might lead players to target you.
  - This can be useful for getting high kills if you are skilled enough.
- If you find a Barrett but have little to no ammunition, it probably isn't worth picking up, since your chance of coming across more ammo is next to nothing.
  - You could, however, try and use it to bait other players into an ambush.
- Despite having a 1x obstacle multiplier, the Barrett is still somewhat capable of destroying cover.
  - This isn't a good idea, though, because of the very rare ammo.
  - If the opponent is near a [Barrel](/obstacles/barrel) or [Super Barrel](/obstacles/super_barrel) that is low on health and smoking, you can shoot it to do extra damage (though probably not as much as actually hitting them with the Barrett).
- Use LMGs such as the [Stoner 63](/weapons/guns/stoner_63) to destroy cover at long range, and then pick off players with Barrett.
  - You can also use assault rifles to weaken your opponent and then finish them off with the Barrett.
- By hiding in a [Bush](/obstacles/bush) and camping, you can surprise your opponents and kill them before they can react.
- If you ever run low on 12.7 ammo, you can break [Ammo Crates](/obstacles/ammo_crate) using a [Maul](/weapons/melee/maul) to get extra ammo.

## Countering

- Use lots of adrenaline to move faster, strafe, and get the Barrett user to miss their bullets. This also wastes their ammunition.
- You can use cover to pretend to move out and get your opponent to shoot, but then move back and have the shot miss you.
- Although the Barrett does a lot of damage, it usually isn't an instant kill, especially in the late game when you likely have high-tier [Armor](/equipment/armor).
- Watch out if you are at 8x or 15x range because the Barrett has a very fast bullet velocity.
- The Barrett can be unwieldy in CQC (Close Quarters Combat) due to its long barrel. Try using a high DPS weapon like a SMG or a shotgun. Weapons with short barrels, like the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues) work best for this.
- Other powerful snipers, like the [Tango 51](/weapons/guns/tango_51), while not as good as the Barrett, can still pack quite a punch against an opponent (especially in dual form).
- Powerful shotgun combos like dual [Model 37s](/weapons/guns/model_37) can sometimes overpower the Barrett at close-range.

# Obtaining

- The only way to get the Barrett is to either find one in a [Gold Airdrop](/obstacles/gold_airdrop_crate) or by breaking a [Flint Stone](/obstacles/flint_stone).

# Trivia

- The Barrett is the second bullpup weapon to be added to Suroi, after the [AUG](/weapons/guns/aug).
- At 129 damage, the Barrett has the highest damage per bullet of any obtainable weapon.
- In real life, the Barrett uses the .50 BMG cartridge.
  - However, this is simplified to the 12.7mm ammunition (technically correct because .50 BMG is 12.7x99mm).
- The Barrett has the fastest bullet speed of any gun (excluding the [Death Ray](/weapons/guns/death_ray)).
- The Barrett was removed because 12.7mm ammunition was renamed to .50 cal and made much more common, which made the Barrett overpowered. Therefore, the developers replaced it with the L115A1 which used a different ammunition type.
