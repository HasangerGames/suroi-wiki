<DevWeapon />

The **Death Ray** is a dev-only weapon initially added in the [v0.4.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.4.0) update, and majorly reworked in the v0.8.0 update. Capable of eliminating almost any object instantly, it also possesses the ability to sail right through cover and players without losing any damage or velocity, making it extremely dangerous.

# Strategies

## Using

- The Death Ray's cover-bypassing capabilities can be a double-edged sword if used incorrectly; make sure not to destroy whatever you're hiding behind when firing the weapon.
- The Death Ray has the fastest projectile in the game by far. It thus excels at long range, because while your time-to-impact is virtually unchanged, your opponent's is vastly increased—this means that while you can perhaps react to their projectile, they have almost no chance of being able to react to yours.
- Despite its power, it is still a single-shot weapon firing every 1.4 seconds.

## Countering

- The Death Ray is a hopeless matchup if you do not have a Death Ray because it is impossible to stall against it. It completely bypasses the cover and has no range preference.
  - Your best hope for stalling out a Death Ray is to try and make its user miss, retaliating against them while they reload.

# Obtaining

As a dev-only weapon, the Death Ray can only be obtained by developers, or on the debug and arena maps.

# Trivia

- This weapon was completely reworked in the [v0.8.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.8.0) update.
  - Previously, it was a weapon that fired 20 projectiles per shot for 200 damage per shot every 60ms (for 3333.333 DPS), had infinite ammo, 20° spread, no penetration, and a range comparable to the [Glock 19](/weapons/guns/g19).
    - That iteration of the Death Ray was weaker since it was possible to stall against it, and it was possible to outrange it.
- It is the first developer weapon (both in its original form and its rework, since the next developer weapon, the [Revitalizer](/weapons/guns/revitalizer) was added in [v0.9.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.9.0))
- Its switch sound contains an easter egg.
- Like other developer weapons, its kill icon contains colors and gradients.
