**Stoves** are a type of [Obstacle](/obstacles) in suroi. The Normal Stove was added in the [v0.9.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.9.0) "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023 and the Small Stove was added in the [v0.15.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.15.0) "Pulling the Pin" update on January 14th, 2024.

# Location & Spawning

Normal Stoves and Small Stoves, similar to other kinds of furniture-like obstacles, spawn in residential buildings such as the [Green House](/buildings/green_house) and [Mobile Home](/buildings/mobile_home).

# Loot & More

All types of Stoves reflect bullets, drop no loot, and always explode upon being broken, dealing heavy damage to nearby players and obstacles.

# Tips

- If another player is near a Stove inside of a building, you can shoot at the Stove with an assault rifle or LMG to explode it and damage or kill the player.
- The Small Stove inside of the Mobile Home is particularly dangerous as the Mobile Home is a very cramped building which leaves little room for you to escape the explosion of the Small Stove if an enemy begins shooting it down, especially due to the relatively low health of Stoves.

# Trivia

- The explosion of the Stove has the same stats as a [Barrel](/obstacles/barrel).
- The Small Stove was once known as the "Mobile Home Stove", but this was changed as the Small Stove was added to more structures besides the Mobile Home.
- The Stoves in Suroi are most likely gas stoves as they explode upon being broken. This also means that the gas used to power the stove is probably stored directly inside of the Stove. Shooting the stove with a gun would cause the gas to leak out and potentially ignite, causing a large explosion.
