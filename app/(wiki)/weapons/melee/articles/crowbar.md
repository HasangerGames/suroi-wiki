The **Crowbar** is a melee weapon added in the [v0.18.2](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.18.2) "Locked & Loaded" update on June 24, 2023.

# Background

A Crowbar, also called a wrecking bar, pry bar or prybar, pinch-bar, or occasionally a prise bar or prisebar, colloquially gooseneck, or pig bar, or in Australia a jemmy, is a lever consisting of a metal bar with a single curved end and flattened points, used to force two objects apart or gain mechanical advantage in lifting; often the curved end has a notch for removing nails.

# Strategies

- The Crowbar should be used for looting or destroying obstacles.
- The Crowbar does decent damage, but it does not have a great DPS.
- The Crowbar is not recommended for melee combat, and should be swapped out for other melee weapons such as the [Falchion](/weapons/melee/falchion), [Maul](/weapons/melee/maul), [Hatchet](/weapons/melee/hatchet), [K-Bar](/weapons/melee/kbar), [Seax](/weapons/melee/seax) and the [Baseball Bat](/weapons/melee/baseball_bat).

## Using

- The Crowbar can destroy all common crates in a single hit, making it a viable item to quickly loot items
- The Crowbar possess a 2.2x obstacle multiplier

## Countering

- As with other melee weapons, the best way to avoid them is to keep the distance between you and your opponent and use CQC guns (Close Quarters Combat) or shotguns such as the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues)
- The Crowbar is a difficult item to use, as long as you can keep decent distance and as well as move around enough, it will be difficult for the crowbar user to hit you

# Obtaining

- One Crowbar is dropped from the [Loot_Barrel](/obstacles/loot_barrel) 
- Crowbars have a small chance of dropping from [Airdrops](/obstacles/aidrops) 

# Trivia

- The first Crowbar was likely made by a blacksmith who modified a lever for a customer. The lever dates back to the Stone Age
- The Crowbar was designed by Nefertari
