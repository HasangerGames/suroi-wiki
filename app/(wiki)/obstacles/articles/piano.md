The **Piano** is an indestructible obstacle added in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) “High-Caliber Negotiations” update on September 22nd, 2024. It is an obstacle designed to add fun and interactivity to the [Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters).

# Location & Spawning  
Currently, only one **Piano** spawns per map in the lounge area of the second floor of the [Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters). 

# Loot & More  
Since the Piano is indestructible, it can't drop loot. However, it can be interacted with: if the Piano is hit using [Fists](/weapons/melee/fists), another melee weapon, or a gun, a sound resembling a dissonant chord being played on a piano plays.

# Tips  
- Don’t attempt to use the Piano as cover as its positioning doesn’t allow you to manipulate its indestructibility. 
- If another suroian is playing the Piano, join in with them or surprise them by using a CQC weapon to quickly obliterate them.
- The Piano can also be played alongside the [Speaker](/obstacles/speaker) to add to the "atmosphere" of the Headquarters.

# Trivia  
- In real life, the Piano is a musical instrument that creates sound through a set of 88 hammers that strike a set of strings which are tuned to a specific pitch. These hammers are linked up to keys which are struck by the pianist's fingers. The Piano was invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori, an Italian harpsichord maker, around the 1700s. Today, the Piano features an extensive amount of repertoire including many solo works, making it one of the most played instruments worldwide.
- Surviv also featured a piano, but it was a keyboard piano while the piano in Suroi is a grand piano.
- The Piano in Suroi only has 36 keys for simplicity.
