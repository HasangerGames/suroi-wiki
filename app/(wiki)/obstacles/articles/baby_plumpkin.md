The **Baby Plumpkin** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) that only spawns on the Harvest and Halloween Maps and was added alongside the Harvest Map in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. Visually, it resembles a smaller sized [Plumpkin](/obstacles/plumpkin).

# Location & Spawning

Three Baby Plumpkins spawn inside of the second chamber inside the laboratory of the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta). 

# Loot & More

Baby Plumpkins don't drop loot. However, when they are broken, they will swap out your current held gun/melee/throwable with another weapon in the same category that is obtainable on the current map. Each obtainable weapon has an equal chance to spawn which means that you are just as likely to get a [L115A1](/weapons/guns/l115a1) than to get a [HP-18](/weapons/guns/hp18).

# Tips

- If you aren't comfortable or satisfied with your current weapons, you can try your luck by breaking a Baby Plumpkin.
- If your opponent is wielding a powerful weapon, you can try to get them to accidentally shoot the Baby Plumpkin. However there is always the risk that they receive an even more powerful weapon.
