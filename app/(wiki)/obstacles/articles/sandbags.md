**Sandbags** are an indestructible obstacle added to the game in the v0.15.0 "Pulling the Pin" update.

# Location and Spawning
Sandbags can spawn around the [Armory](/buildings/armory) and [Port](/buildings/port). A limited number of sandbags also spawn on the [Oil Tanker](/obstacles/oil_tanker_ship).

# Loot & More
Sandbags do not drop loot as they cannot be destroyed.

# Tips
