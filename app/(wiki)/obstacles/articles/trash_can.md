The **Trash Can** is an obstacle added in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) “High-Caliber Negotiations” update on September 22nd, 2024.

# Location & Spawning  

Trash Cans can be found in many buildings with an indoor area such as the [Red House](/buildings/red_houses) or the [Refinery](/buildings/refinery) and usually in their bathrooms and/or office areas.

# Loot & More  

Trash Cans usually drop ammunition but can occasionally drop a [Cola](/healing/cola). Trash Cans can also reflect bullets upon being hit with one.

# Trivia

- Despite a Cola clearing being shown in the texture of the Trash Can, it doesn't always drop one.
- The Trash Can uses the same loot table as the [Trash Bag](/obstacles/trash_bag). 
- The Trash Can in Suroi seems to have an unusually high amount of health compared to real life trash cans, which can easily be dented.
