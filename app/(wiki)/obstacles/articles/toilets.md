**Toilets** are a type of [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.9.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.9.0) "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023.

# Location & Spawning

One "Ceramic" Toilet always spawns in the bathrooms of the [House](/buildings/house) and the [Small House](/buildings/small_house). These toilets have a 30% chance to be used. Porta Potty Toilets spawn in [Porta Potties](/buildings/porta_potty) and have a 70% chance to be used.

# Loot & More

Unused Toilets usually contain 2-3 healing items but can occasionally contain scopes and guns. Used Toilets have a much higher chance of containing guns as well as having a chance of dropping equipment.

# Tips

- Toilets can be used as cover in certain situations, but it is more worthwhile to break them for loot.
- Toilets often contain the best loot in houses along with the [Fridge](/obstacles/fridge), so it is recommended to loot them first.

# Trivia

- The "Ceramic" Toilets were designed by platonthek
- The Porta Potty Toilets were designed by 1092384, Slapdap, and Katloo
