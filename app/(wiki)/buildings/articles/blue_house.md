# Blue House

The Blue House is a variant of the classic [Red House](/buildings/red_house) and is the newest house to be added in the game. 
# Location & Spawning
At least 1 Blue House spawns every map, but usually more (around 2-4) spawn, scattered throughout the map.
# Loot & More
Overall, this structure has average loot, but can be used for late spawners as a source of guns. 
In part of the Blue House, there is a vault, containing 1  [Boxes](/obstacles/box), 1 [Bookshelf](/obstacles/bookshelf)and some ground loot in the front. Because the loot in the vault isn't that good, ideally loot the other parts of the house first. 
 # Tips
- This structure, due to the average loot drop, may often be left untouched - so for players who spawned later, this can be a good source of guns. 
- There is a covered entrance in the back of the house that you can ambush players with; as you are hidden from the other players view. The [Flues](/guns/flues) is a good option for this. To combat this, shoot the [Barrel](/obstacles/barrel) next to the rear entrance, but don't get too close. 
- Explode the [Stove](/obstacles/stove) with a gun to break the [Fridge](/obstacles/fridge) and [Small Drawer](/obstacles/small_drawer)
- Use the skylights to check if there are players inside - but be careful, because often they may be able to see you as well. 
- The vault, while not having good loot, is completely indestrucible *and* reflective, providing an excellent source of cover.
 # Trivia
 - This is the newest house added to the game in the v.19 update. 
 - Only 5 buildings in the game have vaults - this is one of them.
