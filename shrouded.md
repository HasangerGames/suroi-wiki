**Shrouded** is a [Perk](/perks) added in the [v0.2.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.21.0) "Plumpkin Panic" update on October 31st, 2024. It emits a trail of smoke behind the player equipped with it. 

# Effects
The player equipped with Shrouded constantly emits a thick trail of smoke

# Obtaining
In Halloween Mode, Shrouded drops from the [Diseased Plumpkins](/obstacles/diseased_plumpkin) which are scattered through the map and one is located in the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta). Shrouded did **not**  drop from either [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops) or [Gold Airdrops](/obstacles/gold_airdrop_crate).

# Strategies
## Using
- This perk is built for CQC - if a player enters the smoke trail, they will not be able to see the player with the equipped perk. 
- Try and get close to enemies and then shoot them with shotguns or other CQC weapons. They won't be able to see you, limiting what they can do.
  - The final circle can be one of the best places to use this perk for the reasons above. 
- If your opponent has a shotgun, there is a high chance that they can kill you, especially with the [Flues](weapons/guns/flues) or [Model 37](weapons/guns/model_37)
- Try to get in the middle of a fight, blind both players with the smoke, and then kill them. This works well with the [Lycanthropy](/perks/lycanthropy) or [Experimental Treatment](/perks/experimental_treatment)
- 
## Countering
- If you do get in a fight with a player with this perk, use a shotgun or other CQC weapons to try and kill them
    - Spray and pray is a good tactic in this case
- Use [Advanced Athletics] (/perks/advanced_athletics) to combat players, as the 1.6x smoke speed boost can go well with shotguns. 
- Try to get close to your opponent, as they too have a faint view of themselves, and with another player overlapping, it can confuse them.
