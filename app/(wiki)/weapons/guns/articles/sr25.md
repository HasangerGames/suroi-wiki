The **Stoner Rifle-25**, known in-game as the SR-25, is a DMR utilizing 7.62mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.10.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.10.0) "Back with a Bang update on September 14th, 2023. It features higher damage than many other DMRs, albeit at a lower DPS.

# Background

The SR-25 was designed by Eugene Stoner in the early 1990s for the Knight's Armament Company. Stoner combined the AR-10 with the direct-gas system of the AR-15, and various improvements from the M16A2 to create the SR-25. It has been used in small quantities by a small selection of special forces, police, and military around the world. Variants of the SR-25 are also sold to civilians. 

# Strategies

## Using

- The SR-25 can do 570 damage per mag (855 to obstacles), the highest of any DMR, and even higher than the [Mini-14](/weapons/guns/mini14) You can use this to destroy cover such as [Tree](/obstacles/tree) and [Rocks](/obstacles/rock).
- Like most DMRs, the SR-25 is most effective at maximum DPS. Click as fast as you can to get the most out of it.
- Despite having the lowest DPS of any DMR, the SR-25 has higher DPS than many assault rifles and SMGs, and it is more accurate as well.

## Countering

- Use high adrenaline to try and strafe the SR-25 user. This will often avoid much of the damage.
  - Attack while they are reloading.
- Take cover behind indestructible obstacles like [Oil Tanks](/obstacles/oil_tank)
  - Be careful around Rocks and Trees because the SR-25 can easily destroy them, and have plenty of bullets left to finish you off.
- If at close range, rush your opponent with a high-DPS weapon such as a shotgun or an SMG like the [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi)
- The Mini-14 has a higher DPS than the SR-25, making it an effective counter.

# Obtaining

The SR-25 is found in many of the same drops as the [Mini-14](/weapons/guns/mini14). These include [AEGIS](/obstacles/aegis_crate) and [Flint Crates](/obstacles/flint_crate), [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrop_crate), as well as other rare locations. It can also be rarely found as ground loot.
