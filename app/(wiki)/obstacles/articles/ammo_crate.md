The **Ammo Crate** is an impenetrable [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.15.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.15.0) "Pulling the Pin" update on January 14th, 2024. It can only be destroyed using Airdrops or weapons with piercing damage.

# Location & Spawning

Ammo Crates can be found in many structures, especially medium and large structures such as the [Large Bridge](/buildings/large_bridge) and [Armory](/buildings/armory).

# Loot & More

Ammo Crates drop two loot instances of the following: 60 rounds of 5.56mm, 7.62mm, or 9mm or 10 rounds of 12 gauge. Additionally, it has a 33% chance to drop a rare ammo type: 20 rounds of .50 cal (60% chance), 6 rounds of .338 lapua magnum (20% chance), or a single Curadell (20% chance). Ammo Crates can only be broken using weapons with piercing damage (such as a [Maul](/weapons/melee/maul) or a [Hatchet](/weapons/melee/hatchet)) or an [Airdrop](/obstacles/airdrops) landing on top of one.

# Tips

- Since Ammo Crates aren't easily destroyed, they can be effectively used as cover from enemies.
