The **Mobile Home Window** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.15.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.15.0) "Pulling the Pin" update on January 14th, 2024.
# Location and Spawning

A single Mobile Home Window spawns in every [Mobile Home](/buildings/mobile_home) on the exterior.

# Loot & More

The Mobile Home Window doesn't drop loot. 

# Tips

- If you are ambushed inside the mobile home, you can destroy the window and escape as the space that the window occupies has no hitbox once the window is destroyed.
   - Since many people know this trick, you can aim at the window to ambush players inside the Mobile Home, not just the door.
- Don't use the Mobile Home Window as cover since it is easily destroyed.
