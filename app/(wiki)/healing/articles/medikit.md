The **Medikit** is a consumable that heals 100 health and was added in the [v0.4.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.4.0) "Supplies received" update on June 17th, 2023. They spawn rarely around the map. To use a Medikit, either click on the icon in your inventory or press 6 on your keyboard. A Medikit takes 6 seconds to use.

# Background

Medical kits, also known as first aid kits, contain a variety of different supplies and equipment that both civilians and first responders can use to treat injuries or ailments. Learn more about medikits [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid_kit).

# Strategies

## Using

- Try and save the Medikit for an emergency when you need it. Medikits are rare, and you might not be able to use another one.
  - If you see a Medikit, it is worth grabbing since you may need it later on.
- The Medikit is more efficient than Gauze, especially if you are low on health.
- Make sure you are in a safe and/or easily defensible location when using a Medikit, as the slowdown and long usage time make you vulnerable.
  - If someone starts attacking you, cancel the Medikit and start fighting (the default keybind is X).
  - However if you still have a little bit of health and are behind cover, you might be able to let the Medikit finish before fighting.
- If you are caught in the gas towards the later stages of the game, use the Medikit as soon as you start taking damage, as you will need to out-heal the gas.
  - Use adrenaline to help regenerate more health.

## Countering

- If you see a player out in the open using healing particles, you should attack them. There's a good chance that they are low on health and will make for an easy kill.
  - Watch out, though, as some players will "bait" and pretend to heal when they actually have high health.
- If you're in a fight, and you think your opponent is low enough that they are trying to use a Medikit, keep being aggressive and attack them. Don't give them the chance to use a Medikit.

## Obtaining

Medikits are most commonly found in Toilets and the Porta-Potty. They can also be found rarely in crates or as ground loot.

# Trivia

- Before Medikits and other consumables were added, the only way to heal yourself was to break a Health Crate
  - Health Crates have now been removed from the game
- "Medikit" is a reference to the first aid kits that appear in many Doom games
