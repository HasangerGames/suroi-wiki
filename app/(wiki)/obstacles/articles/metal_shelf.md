The **Metal Shelf** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.9.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.9.0) "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023.

# Location & Spawning

Two Metal Shelves spawn across from each other in the [Warehouse](/buildings/warehouse) in suroi versions before [v0.15.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.15.0). It is currently an unused obstacle, as the Warehouse has been redesigned.

# Loot & More

Metal Shelves are indestructible and reflect bullets.

# Tips

- The Metal Shelves in the old Warehouse always spawn with three [Boxes](/obstacles/boxes) on top of them. They can be broken for loot.
