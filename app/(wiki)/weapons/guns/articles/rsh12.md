The **Револьвер Штурмовой калибра 12,7 (Assault Revolver Calibre 12.7)**, known in-game as the **RSh-12**, is a suppressed, revolving, and double-action pistol utilizing the .50 Cal ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) "High Caliber Negotiations" update on September 22nd, 2024. The RSh-12 features a very low magazine size, but extreme damage.

# Background
The RSh-12 was created for Russian Federal Security Service for use in high-stakes operations. Designed by Viktor Zelenko of the KPB Instrument Design Bureau, it fires the 12.7x55mm cartridge also used by the [VKS sniper rifle](/weapons/guns/vks) and ShAk-12 battle rifle. Unlike most revolvers, it fires from the bottom chamber rather than the top. The RSh-12 features a gas system that is purported to be similar to that of the [M1895](/weapons/guns/m1895), and has support for a flashlight, suppressor, foregrip, buttstock. Not much is know about if the RSh-12 ever entered production, and if it was ever used. In real life, the large caliber is most likely best suited for anti-material purposes in a close-quarters situation, such as shooting door locks.

# Strategies
## Using
- The RSh-12 has limited ammo capacity, but enough damage to kill most players in 4-5 well placed shots. Try to lure your enemies away from cover, or destroy it with a secondary weapon such as an LMG.
- You can use the RSh-12 as a good substitute for a shotgun at close ranges, with the same playstyle of peeking from cover. 
- Use the RSh-12 to start the fight on a significant health advantage, as two shots will bring your opponent to half health or lower, then finish with your secondary weapon. This can also be done in reverse if the enemy is trying to retreat.
- Despite its otherwise short range, the RSh-12 can still outrange powerful weapons such as the [Vepr-12](/weapons/guns/vepr12), [Vector](/weapons/guns/vector), and [M3K](/weapons/guns/m3k) while doing significant burst damage to them. 
- Wait between longer distance shots to take advantage of the First Shot Accuracy. This will waste fewer bullets to spread.
- If you're running low on ammo, find a piercing weapon and look for ammo crates. They commonly drop 20 rounds of .50 cal ammunition.
- If you find the dual variant of the RSh-12, don't hesitate to aggressively push players at close range and inside buildings. The dual RSh-12 DPS is high enough to win fights against anything but a [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues) or possibly [Dual DEagle](/weapons/guns/deagle).

## Countering
- The RSh-12 has a significant reload time and rare ammo, and every missed shot matters. Try to make the RSh-12 user to waste their ammo.
- The bullet velocity of the RSh-12 is rather low. Take advantage of this to dodge shots closer to the edge of its range.
- Use long range, accurate weapons such as the [MCX Spear](/weapons/guns/mcx_spear), or any DMR or sniper rifle to pepper the RSh-12 user down from beyond their firing range.
- Cover is especially effective against the RSh-12. [Smoke grenades](/weapons/throwables/smoke_grenade) are equally good, as the RSh-12 user cannot afford to waste bullets blindly firing into smoke.
- If you encounter a player with the dual variant of the RSh-12, do not engage them unless absolutely necessary. The extreme burst damage and accuracy can kill even fully armored players in around a second.

# Obtaining
- Currently, the single RSh-12 can only be obtained from the [RSh-12 Case](/obstacles/rsh_case) located in the [Blue House](/buildings/headquarters_meta) basement. In Harvest Mode, it can be found as a drop from [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops) and a rare drop from world loot.

- The dual RSh-12 can be obtained from the [Dual RSh-12 Case](/obstacles/dual_rsh_case) which occasionally replaces the normal RSh-12 Case, the [Dual RSh-12 Gun Mount](/obstacles/gun_mounts) sometimes found in the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker)'s vault, and from [Gold Airdrops](/obstacles/gold_airdrop) and the [Flint Stone](/obstacles/flint_stone).

# Trivia 
- The RSh-12 is the second revolver added to the game.
- A variant of the RSh-12 chambered in 9x39mm also exists and is known as the RSh-9.
