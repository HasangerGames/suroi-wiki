The **BLR Lightweight '81 Stainless Takedown**, known in-game as the **BLR 556**, is a common lever-action DMR chambered in 5.56mm that can only be found on the Harvest Map. It was added to the game in the [v0.22.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.16.0) "Cold Steel" update on December 11th, 2024.

# Background

The BLR Lightweight '81 is a lever action rifle and is a variant of the original Browning BLR. It was introduced in 1995 and is currently produced by p Firearms in Japan for the Browning Arms Company. Most importantly, the BLR Lightweight '81 used an aluminum receiver instead of a steel receiver in the original BLR which made the rifle lighter. Some other modifications were also done to the action of the BLR Lightweight '81 compared to the original BLR to make it compatible with a wider range of calibers.

# Strategies

## Using

- The BLR 556 can be seen as a worse version of the [Model 89](/weapons/guns/model_89) as it has the same fire delay.
- The BLR 556 is a very useful gun early game as it can deal 80 damage just by hitting two shots, more than the damage of the [Tango 51](/weapons/guns/tango_51). 
  - Make sure you always have all five shots ready to be fired to ensure maximum damage.
  - The BLR 556 becomes less useful mid game and almost obsolete end game due to the low magazine size and somewhat long reload time for such a low magazine capacity weapon which makes the BLR 556 unable to sustain solid DPS against an opponent as opposed to other DMRs like the [Mini-14](/weapons/guns/mini14) or even the [SKS](/weapons/guns/sks) due to its ability to reload two shots at a time.
- The BLR 556 is somewhat similar to the [CZ-600](/weapons/guns/cz600), being chambered in the same ammunition, having the same rarity, and an identical magazine capacity. Compared to the CZ-600, the BLR 556 has a higher fire rate and DPS while the CZ-600 has higher single-shot damage, higher bullet speed, less spread, and a shorter reload time.
  - Generally, the CZ-600 will perform better at long range while the BLR 556 will perform better at short and mid range.

## Countering

- The BLR 556 is usually not very hard to counter; most other early game weapons such as the SKS and [HP-18](/weapons/guns/hp18) are directly superior in terms of DPS and can be used to counter the BLR 556 at short and mid ranges.
  - Still, this does not mean you can be careless. The BLR 556 is still very deadly early game in the hands of a skilled player and can bring your health down very quickly due to the high damage.

# Obtaining

The BLR 556 can only be found on the Harvest Map, where it is a fairly common weapon and is around the same rarity as of the [M3K](/weapons/guns/m3k) and CZ-600.

# Trivia
- Similar to the [RGS](/weapons/guns/rgs) and [M1 Garand](/weapons/guns/m1_garand), the BLR 556 has a special firing sound that plays when the last round in the magazine is fired.
