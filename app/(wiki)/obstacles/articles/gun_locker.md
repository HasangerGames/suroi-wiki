# Gun Locker

The Gun Locker is a good loot drop if you have the right melees to break it, but they are a rare find. 

# Location and Spawning

 Only 2 spawn per map, both in the armory [Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters) 

# Tips

- The [Falchion](/weapons/melees/falchion) is a quick grab from the 2nd floor - it also breaks the Gun Lockers, an easy way to get good loot. Note that any piercing weapon can break the lockers, not just the Falchion
- The [Mini-14](/weapons/guns/mini14) is also in the vault on a [Gun Mount](/loot/#gun_mount_mini_14), so even without a piercing weapon you can obtain it. 
- Guns such as the  [AK-47](/weapons/guns/ak47) and [Model 37](/weapons/guns/model_37) are more common, but rarer loot like the [MCX Spear](/weapons/guns/mcxspear) to the [Tango 51](/weapons/guns/tango_51) are all possible. View the full loot table [here](/loot/#gun_locker).

# Trivia

The Gun Lockers were once (in beta testing) breakable by fists, but soon switched to requiring armor piercing weapons to loot.
