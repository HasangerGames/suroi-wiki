<Stub/>
The **Hatchet** is a melee weapon added in the [v0.18.1](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.18.1) update on June 21, 2024.

# Background
A hatchet is a single-handed striking tool with a sharp blade on one side used to cut and split wood, and a hammerhead on the other side. Hatchets may also be used for hewing when making flattened surfaces on logs; when the hatchet head is optimized for this purpose it is called a hewing hatchet. Fire hatchets have a spike on the back and are used to break down windows and doors.

# Strategies

## Using
- The Hatchet can be used to break [Ammo Crates](/obstacles/ammo_crate) and [Gun Lockers](/obstacles/gun_locker) that aren't breakable by [Fists](/weapons/melee/fists).
- With a very high DPS, the Hatchet fairs well against most other melee weapons.

## Countering

- Watch out when a player with Hatchet tries to approach you at close range, use shotguns when needed.
- Switch to melee as soon as they are too close, most melees have more DPS than Hatchet so try to utilize them.
  
# Obtaining

The Hatchet can be obtained from the [Hatchet Stump](/obstacles/hatchet_stump), [Loot Trees](obstacles/loot_tree) and [Airdrops](obstacles/airdrops). It can also be found commonly in [Melee Crates](/obstacles/crates) on the Harvest and Halloween Maps.
