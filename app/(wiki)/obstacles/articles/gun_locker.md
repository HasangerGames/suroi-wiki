# Location and Spawning

- Two Gun Lockers spawn in the vault on the first floor of the [Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters). This vault also contains a guranteed [Gun Mount](/obstacles/gun_mounts) with a [Mini-14](/weapons/guns/mini14).

- Two Gun Lockers spawn in the security office and northeast hall of the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker). 

- One Gun Locker can also be found on the second floor of the [Barn](/buildings/barn) and in the vault on the second floor of the [Lodge](/buildings/lodge).

# Loot & More

Gun Lockers drop 1-2 guns. See the special guns tier in the [Loot Tables](/loot) for more information. Gun Lockers reflect bullets and can only be broken using melee weapons that deal piercing damage.

# Tips

- Inside of the Headquarters, the two Gun Lockers that spawn in the vault on the first floor can be broken by getting the [Falchion](/weapons/melees/falchion) from the [Falchion Case](/obstacles/falchion_case) on the 2nd floor.
	- Gun Lockers can also be used as great cover from enemies when fighting inside or near the vault containing them.
- Inside of the Plumpkin Bunker, the two Gun Lockers found within the structure can be broken by getting the [Fire Hatchet](/weapons/melees/fire_hatchet) from the [Fire Hatchet Case](/obstacles/fire_hatchet_case) near the northwest entrance.
- Guns such as the [AK-47](/weapons/guns/ak47) and [Model 37](/weapons/guns/model_37) are common drops, but rarer loot like the [MCX Spear](/weapons/guns/mcxspear) and the [Tango 51](/weapons/guns/tango_51) are all possible. View the full loot table [here](/loot/#gun_locker).

# Trivia

- The Gun Lockers were once (in beta testing) breakable by fists, but soon switched to requiring armor piercing weapons to loot.
