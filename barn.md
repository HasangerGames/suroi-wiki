# Barn
The **barn** is a large structure added in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0), or **Harvest** mode update. It has a good amount of loot, but certain bottlenecks can be very dangerous. 

# Location & Spawning
1 or more barns spawn in Harvest mode maps. There is no distinct location of where it might spawn.

# Areas

## Ground Floor
When entering through the [Barn Door](/obstacles/barn_door), there are 2 large [Hay Bales](/obstacles/hay_bale). These and the Barn Door make excellent cover - they have 180 and 150 health, respectively. 
Ideally, go loot the [Flint Crate](/obstacles/flint_crate) or the [Gun Case](obstacles/gun_case) first, as they have the best loot on this floor. Once broken, go to the 2nd floor through either of the 2 stairwells. 

## Second Floor
Break the [Gun Case](obstacles/gun_case) or the [Gun Locker](obstacles/gun_locker) first, but you need a piercing weapon (e.g. [Maul](/weapons/melee/maul)) to break the Gun Locker. The 2nd floor is cramped and if you don't have a CQC weapon like the [Micro Uzi(/weapons/guns/micro_uzi) or a shotgun, you may be killed. Be wary of [C4s](/weapons/throwables/c4) that may be placed on the stairwells - their grey color makes for a nearly invisible death trap. 

# Tips
- Hide in the overhang (it's next to the side [Door](/obstacles/door)) with a shotgun to get some kills, but be careful to not hide next to the [Ammo Crate](/obstacles/ammo_crate), as there is a hole in the ceiling where players can see you. Alternatively, you can plant a [C4](/weapons/throwables/c4) there and go behind the door in case the C4 doesn't kill them.
- The [Barrel](/obstacles/barrel) that is next to the rear stairwell can be damaged, and when somebody exits the stairs, shoot the barrel to kill or heavily damage them. Many players don't think twice about this strategic location. 
- Plant [C4s](/weapons/throwables/c4) in the stairwells, as their gray color can disguise them. This works especially well with the rear stairwell and the last tip, as when the C4 blows up, the barrel often explodes with it.
- On the 2nd floor, you can see players on the ground floor. Use this to your advantange, as they cannot see you - [Grenade Crates](/obstacles/grenade_crate), near the side entrance are a good source of throwables and can be thrown down on the first floor, insta-killing many players.
