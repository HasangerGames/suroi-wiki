The **Stoeger Industries M3K Freedom Series Defense Shotgun**, known in-game as the **M3K** is a semi-automatic shotgun utilizing 12-gauge ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.2.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.2.0) "Fun guns" update on May 28th, 2023. It has good range, decent damage, and a large magazine.

# Background

The M3K is an affordable budget semi-automatic shotgun offered by Stoeger Industries. Instead of a gas system to chamber the next round, it uses an inertia system developed by Benelli (Stoeger is a subsidiary of Benelli). This equates to fewer parts, meaning the M3K is very reliable and requires low maintenance. The family of shotguns is well known for the abundance of aftermarket parts and add-ons.

# Strategies

## Using

- The M3K has the longest range out of any shotgun, as well as great accuracy. Use this to avoid close confrontations with higher-DPS weapons.
  - A good strategy is to find an obstacle, such as a [Rock](/obstacles/rock) and "peek out" to fire a shot, and then keep hiding. This will avoid much of the damage from weapons, such as assault rifles and DMRs.
- Use the M3K with another shotgun, such as the [Model 37](/weapons/guns/model_37). This will cover both long-range and short-range.
  - This works best with quickswitching.
- If your opponent also has an M3K, use the aforementioned "peek" strategy and avoid being damaged while wasting their ammo.
- The M3K's long-range also pairs well with a sniper like the [Mosin-Nagant](/weapons/guns/mosin_nagant), if you quickswitch both. This is great if you can't find another sniper.

## Countering

- If you have high adrenaline, you can strafe the M3K user, as the tight spread makes it more punishing than other shotguns.
- The M3K's long barrel makes it more difficult to use in very close combat, where weapons, such as the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues) are much better.
  - This may also work with an SMG, such as a [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi), but watch out if they try to melee you.

# Obtaining

The M3K is uncommon in general world loot, but fairly common in rarer loot sources such as [AEGIS Crates](/obstacles/aegis_crate).

# Trivia

- The M3K was one of the first guns to be added to the game, alongside the [AK-47](/weapons/guns/ak47).
  - It is also the first shotgun in the game.
- The M3K presumably fires a lower powered load than the [Model 37](/weapons/guns/model_37) and [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues), which explains its lower damage.
- Despite also being semi-automatic, it cannot fire as fast as the [HP18](/weapons/guns/hp18).
- In real life, the M3K has a magazine capacity of 10 (in barrel) + 1 (loaded).
  - Most likely, the M3K in-game uses an aftermarket magazine that only holds 9 rounds.
