The **Port Shed** is a sub-building of the [Port](/buildings/port). It was added in the [v0.11.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.11.0) "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023. It features indestructible walls, a bookshelf, and a desk.

# Location & Spawning

One Port Shed spawns towards the center of every Port. It is near the [Barrier](/obstacles/barrier). A Port Shed also spawns in the lower right of the [Armory](/buildings/armory).

# Loot & More

The Port Shed has barely any loot (only a [Bookshelf](/obstacles/bookshelf) and a [Table](/obstacles/table)/[Chair](/obstacles/chair)) and is generally not worth checking out.

# Tips

- While it doesn't have the best loot, the Port Shed's indestructible nature makes it a good refuge if you need to heal during a fight.
- You can hide under the desk to ambush other players.
  - This is generally not as effective as hiding under the desk in the [Refinery](/buildings/refinery), because few players bother to enter it.
