**Pumpkins** are a type of [Obstacle](/obstacles) that come in two sizes and only spawn on the Harvest and Halloween Maps. The Normal Pumpkin was added to the game in the [v0.12.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.12.0) "Trick-or-Tweak" update on October 29th, 2023 and the Large Pumpkins were added to the game in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. Normal Pumpkins are a very common obstacle on both the Harvest and Halloween Maps while Large Pumpkins are rarer.

# Location & Spawning

200 Normal Pumpkins spawn around the Harvest and Halloween Maps in random locations. 

Five Large Pumpkins spawn around the same maps as the Normal Pumpkin. However, a huge amount of Large Pumpkins spawn near the entrance of the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta).

# Loot & More

Pumpkins drop common loot similar to crates such as ammo and guns. The Large Pumpkin drops 2-3 loot instances while the Normal Pumpkin drops one.

# Tips

- The small size and relatively low health of the Normal Pumpkin make it a poor choice for cover. However, the Large Pumpkin is more effective because of its higher health and larger hitbox compared to the Normal Pumpkin.

# Trivia

- During the Halloween 2023 event, the Normal Pumpkin had a 95% chance to drop a [G17 (scoped)](/weapons/guns/g17_scoped) and a 5% chance to drop a [USAS-12](/weapons/guns/usas12).
