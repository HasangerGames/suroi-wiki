Trees are a type of obstacle that spawn frequently on the map. They were added to the game in the [v0.1.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.1.0) "We're back, baby" update on May 20th, 2023, and come in five variants.

# Location & Spawning

Trees are extremely common obstacles and can spawn just about anywhere on the map. Birch and Pine Trees are rarer than Oak Trees, making them harder to find. Maple Trees and Dormant Oak Trees only spawn on the Harvest and Halloween Maps.

# Loot & More

Trees drop no loot upon being broken.

# Tips

- Trees make decent cover from enemies.
  - Pine Trees have a larger hitbox, making it harder for your opponent to shoot you from behind your cover.
  - Birch Trees have higher health, allowing you to buy more time or force your opponent to waste additional ammo.
  - Oak Trees have more visual cover and can be effectively hidden under, but offer no statistical benefits.
  - Dormant Oak Trees aren't as ideal for cover as they have lower health than any other tree variant and also have very poor visual cover. They only spawn on the Harvest and Halloween maps.
  - Maple Trees are much larger and have higher health and visual cover, but also only spawn on the Harvest and Halloween Maps.
  - However, all five variants can be easily destroyed with any high-DPS weapon in a matter of seconds.
- If your opponent is hiding behind a Tree to avoid shots or heal up, just shoot the Tree down. They have low health and are easy to destroy.
- In the end game, campers may hide in the overlapping area of two Trees or a single Tree if they have a skin that helps camouflage them or the Tree has good visual cover (usually only Oak and maple Trees). Shoot a bullet or two into these areas to chase any remaining players out.
