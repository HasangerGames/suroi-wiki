The **Flint Stone** is an indestructible [Obstacle](/obstacles) added to the game in the v0.10.0 "Back with a Bang" update on September 14th, 2023. It is only destroyable with an airdrop, but drops good loot.

# Location & Spawning

Only one Flint Stone spawns per map, and it can be anywhere on the map. The Flint Stone is very difficult to see on the map due to its small size.

# Loot & More

One way to break the Flint Stone is to obtain a rare [Radio](/weapons/guns/radio) and use the summoned airdrop to destroy the Flint Stone. Technically, a naturally spawned airdrop can also break it, but this is exceedingly rare. You can also break the FLint Stone using a weapon with piercing damage such as the [Maul](/weapons/melee/maul).
The Flint Stone has very good [loot](/loot#flint_stone), and always drops a [Gold Airdrop gun](/loot#gold_airdrop_guns). Each one of these has a 33.33% (1/3) chance of dropping.

# Tips
