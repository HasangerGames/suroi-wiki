The **Fridge** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.9.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.9.0) "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023. It drops [Colas](/healing/colas).

# Location & Spawning

Fridges spawn in the Kitchens of both [Houses](/buildings/house) and [Small Houses](/buildings/small_house). It also spawns in the Barracks of the [Armory](/buildings/armory).

# Loot & More

The Fridge reflects bullets and always drops 2-3 [Colas](/healing/colas) upon being broken.

# Tips

- Many players don't know that you can break Fridges, so you can often find them late-game in Houses/Small Houses that are otherwise completely looted.
- Be careful if you're using a gun to destroy the Fridge, as you could damage yourself with the reflected bullets.
