The **Smoke Grenade** is a [Throwable](/throwables) added in the v0.15.0 "Pulling the Pin" update on Jan 14th, 2024. Upon detonation, it releases clouds of smoke that lasts for around twenty seconds.

# Strategies

## Using

- The Smoke Grenade can be used as a way to quickly get a temporary place to hide.
  - This means that you can use it as a way to easily dodge bullets or to heal, as the enemy does not know where you are.
  - You can also use it in offense as a way to hide yourself while attacking, making it harder for your enemy to find your exact location.
  - However, while inside smoke, your scope is reduced to 1x, which can be make it hard to see enemies. 
- Unlike the [Frag Grenade](/weapons/throwables/frag_grenade), Smoke Grenades can't be cooked.
## Countering

- If the enemy is using the Smoke Grenade offensively, you can also hide in the smoke when it is safe to do so.
  - Avoid this if the enemy has powerful close-range weapons like shotguns and the [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi).

# Obtaining
Smoke Grenades can sometimes be obtained from [Regular Crates](/obstacles/regular_crate), but are much more often dropped from [Grenade Crates](/obstacles/grenade_crate).
