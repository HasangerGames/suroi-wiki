The Iver Johnson Arms HP-18, known in-game as the HP18, is a common semi-automatic shotgun firing 12-gauge ammunition. It was added to the game in the v0.7.0 "Geared Up" update on July 9th, 2023.

# Background
The HP-18 is a cheaper entry level shotgun offered by Iver Johnson Arms. It has features such as a 2-piece detachable pistol stock, a Picatinny rail, and a flashlight rail. It is offered by a variety of dealers such as Palmetto State Armory and Sportsman's Outdoor Superstore.

# Strategies
## Using
- The HP18 has very high spread, which makes it necessary to get close to your opponent to be used effectively.
- Like most shotguns, you can pair the HP18 with a long-range gun to cover both CQC and long-range scenarios.
- The HP18 is a semi-automatic weapon, so to achieve the highest DPS you must fire as fast as possible.
  - However, be careful with your shots or you will quickly run out of ammo.
- Late game, the HP18 is not as viable due to its low damage and high spread. This makes it ineffective against stronger armors.
  - If possible, replace the HP18 for another shotgun such as the <Link href="/weapons/guns/model_37">Model 37</Link> or the <Link href="/weapons/guns/m3k">M3K</Link>
- As with other shotguns, use high adrenaline to help rush your opponent. Switch to your secondary gun or reload one shell to finish off an opponent.

## Countering
- The best way to counter the HP18 is to stay out of its short range. Use mid-range or long-range weapons such as assault rifles, DMRs, and snipers to kill your opponent.
- If you do end up close to a HP18 user, don't try to melee them, as getting close could result in all of the pellets hitting you.
  - You can do this if the player has little armor and is not very skilled, but it is risky.
- Any other shotgun will overpower the HP18 at close-range as well as mid-range.
- Take cover behind obstacles such as rocks. The HP18's 0.5x obstacle multiplier makes the gun weak against cover.
  - If using a shotgun against the HP18, keep engagement one shots long if possible; the HP18's advantage is its autofire, and keeping engagements shorts deprives it of this advantage.

# Obtaining
The HP18 is the most common shotgun available on the normal map. It can be found as ground loot, in crates, and many other places.

# Trivia
- The HP18 replaced the now-removed 940 Pro in update v0.7.0.
- The HP18 fires birdshot, which explains its low damage and high pellet count.
