**Doors** are a type of interactive [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.9.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.9.0) "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023.

# Location & Spawning

Doors spawn in between rooms of many structures, such as the [Small House](/buildings/small_house). A Porta Potty Door spawns at the entrance of a [Porta Potty](/buildings/porta_potty). One Vault Door spawns each in the entrance to the Vaults of the [Cargo Ship](/buildings/cargo_ship) or [Oil Tanker](/buildings/oil_tanker) in the [Port](/buildings/port) and the entrance to the vault in the [Armory](/buildings/armory). Glass doors open automatically when a player approaches them. Glass Doors and Secret doors currently only spawn in the [Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters_meta). Metal Doors are indestructible doors, some of which are locked and require a puzzle to be solved in order to become usable. Garage Doors aren't interactive and must be broken to pass through. They only spawned in the Garage area of the removed [House](/buildings/house) structure.

# Loot & More

Wooden, Glass, Metal and Porta Potty Doors can be interacted with to change their position, which can allow players to enter another area without breaking the Door. Punching an interactable Door using fists or a melee weapon causes it to open in the direction of the swing. However, some metal doors cannot be used until they are unlocked. Vault Doors can only be opened by solving a puzzle nearby. All breakable Doors drop nothing upon being broken.

# Tips

- Wooden and Porta Potty Doors are useful as cover, as they can have their position manipulated to fit a player's needs or to annoy an opponent.
  - However, both have low health and can't withstand many bullets without getting destroyed.
  - Metal Doors can still have their position changed but can't be destroyed, making them better for cover compared to wooden doors.
  - Glass Doors shouldn't be used as cover due to their low health.
- Vault Doors can be used as an indestructible cover once opened.
- Garage Doors can be used as an alternative exit to the removed House.
