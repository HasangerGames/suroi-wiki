**Doors** are a type of interactive [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the v0.9.0 "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023.

# Location & Spawning

Doors spawn in between rooms of many structures, such as the [Small House](/buildings/small_house). A Porta Potty Door spawns at the entrance of a [Porta Potty](/buildings/porta_potty). One Vault Door spawns each in the entrance to the Vaults of the [Ship](/buildings/ship) or [Oil Tanker](/buildings/oil_tanker) in the [Port](/buildings/port) and the entrance to the vault in the [Armory](/buildings/armory). Garage Doors aren't interactive and must be broken to pass through. They only spawn in the Garage area of the [House](/buildings/house).

# Loot & More

Wooden and Porta Potty Doors can be interacted with to change their position, which can allow players to enter another area without breaking the Door. Punching a Wooden Door using fists or a melee weapon causes it to open in the direction of the swing. Vault Doors can only be opened by solving a puzzle nearby. All breakable Doors drop nothing upon being broken.

# Tips

- Wooden and Porta Potty Doors are useful as cover, as they can have their position manipulated to fit a player's needs or to annoy an opponent.
  - However, both have low health and can't withstand many bullets without getting destroyed.
- Vault Doors can be used as an indestructible cover once opened.
- Garage Doors can be used as an alternative exit to the House.
