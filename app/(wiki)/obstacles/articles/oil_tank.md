The **Oil Tank** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added to the game in the [v0.5.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.5.0) "Locked & Loaded" update on June 24th, 2023. It is indestructible and makes for good cover against opponents.

# Location & Spawning

10 Oil Tanks spawn around the map in random locations.

# Loot & More

The Oil Tank is indestructible and therefore drops no loot.

# Tips

- If you're low on health or facing an opponent with much better weapons, you can use an Oil Tank to waste your opponent's ammo and frustrate them.
  - Simply move in the same direction as they are when they try to chase you.
  - Having high adrenaline helps in not being caught.
- If a player is trying to evade you using an Oil Tank, try and move in an unpredictable way to catch them off-guard
  - Having adrenaline helps massively with this, due to the speed boost.
- Sometimes, opponents will be stuck in the gas behind an Oil Tank. Shoot at them to make them hesitate to abandon their cover and get to the safe zone. This will result in them taking lots of damage and being an easy kill when they decide to run for it.
- CQC weapons like SMGs and Shotguns work best around Oil Tanks.

# Trivia

- Originally, five Oil Tanks spawned randomly around the map, and two were coded to spawn close to the center of the map.
  - This was done because, at the time, there were no buildings and finding cover late-game was difficult.
  - This was removed in [v0.13.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.13.0).
