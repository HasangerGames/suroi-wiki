The **Golden Aegis Case** is an obstacle added in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) “High-Caliber Negotiations” update on September 22nd, 2024.

# Location & Spawning  

A Golden Aegis Case can always be found in the Secret Room on the second floor of the [AEGIS Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters). 

# Loot & More  

The Golden Aegis Case drops the [DEagle](/weapons/guns/deagle), which has a 5% chance to be the dual variant. Additionally, the Golden Aegis Case can also very rarely drop a [G19](/weapons/guns/g19).

# Tips  

- Since this crate drops a guranteed weapon, you should go for this crate first if you enter the Headquarters through the fire exit that leads directly to the second floor. Alternatively, you can go for the [Falchion Case](/obstacles/falchion_case) in the meeting room instead.

# Trivia

- It is unknown why "golden" and "aegis" are reversed in the idString of this obstacle.
