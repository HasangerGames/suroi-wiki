# Blue House

The Blue House is a variant of the classic [Red House](/buildings/red_house) and is the newest house to be added in the game, being added in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) "High Caliber Negotiations" update on September 22nd, 2024.
# Location & Spawning

At least one Blue House spawns on each map, but usually more (around 2-4) spawn scattered around the map.

# Loot & More
Overall, this structure has average loot, but can be used for late spawners as a source of guns. 
In part of the Blue House, there is a vault, containing one [Box](/obstacles/box), one [Bookshelf](/obstacles/bookshelf) and some ground loot in the front. Ideally, Because the loot in the vault isn't that good, loot the other parts of the house first. 
 # Tips
- This structure, due to the mediocre loot, may often be left untouched. Therefore, for players who spawn later, this can be a good source of guns.
- There is a covered entrance in the back of the house that you can ambush players with since you are hidden from the view of other players. The [Flues](/guns/flues) is a good option for this. 
  - To combat this, shoot the [Barrel](/obstacles/barrel) next to the rear entrance, but don't get too close. 
- Explode the [Stove](/obstacles/stove) with a gun to break the [Fridge](/obstacles/fridge) and [Small Drawer](/obstacles/small_drawer) at the same time.
- Use the skylights to check if there are players inside, but be careful; often they may be able to see you as well. 
- The vault, while not having good loot, is completely indestructible *and* reflective, providing an excellent source of cover.
 # Trivia
 - This is the newest house added to the game in the v0.19.0 update. 
 - Only 5 buildings in the game have vaults - this is one of them.
