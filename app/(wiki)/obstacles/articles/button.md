# Location & Spawning

Four Buttons spawn inside the [Armory](/buildings/armory) Vault. They are linked to a puzzle that unlocks the inner vault which contains a [Briefcase](/obstacles/briefcase). For the puzzle solution, go to the [Armory](/buildings/armory) article.

# Loot & More

Buttons are usually linked to puzzles. They can be pressed by interacting with them. They cannot be broken and can't drop loot.

# Tips

Buttons cannot be used as cover since their hitbox is too small.
