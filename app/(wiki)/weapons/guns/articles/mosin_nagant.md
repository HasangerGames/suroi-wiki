The **3-line Rifle M1891** or **Mosin's Rifle**, known in-game as the **Mosin-Nagant**, is a bolt-action sniper rifle utilizing 7.62mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.4.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.4.0) "Supplies received" update on June 17th, 2023.

# Background

The Mosin-Nagant was designed in 1891 by Captain Sergei Mosin and Émile Nagant for the Russian Empire. It saw the introduction of the popular 7.62x54mmR cartridge. Despite its old age, the rifle has seen use in a multitude of conflicts and is still in active service in some areas.

# Strategies

## Using

- Don't judge the Mosin-Nagant by its low DPS. The high damage and excellent range make it among the best weapons in the game.
- As a sniper, the Mosin-Nagant works very well at long-range against weapons with less range and accuracy.
- The Mosin-Nagant is best used when quickswitched with another sniper or a shotgun. This allows you to have high damage output at both close and long range.
  - The [M3K](/weapons/guns/m3k) and [Model 37](/weapons/guns/model_37) are both good choices to pair with the Mosin-Nagant. The Model 37 packs more damage, but the M3K may be better if you have an 8x or 15x scope and expect a lot of long-range engagements.
- Always reload bullets when not actively engaging, as the Mosin-Nagant takes 850ms to load each bullet (4.25 seconds for a full reload) and this saved time could win you a fight.
  - If you only have 1 bullet left, it's better to shoot it and use the full clip reload than to reload 4 bullets individually.
- If you're using the Mosin-Nagant at long range, make sure to lead your shots to ensure you hit your target.
- A great strategy to use is to find cover such as a [Rock](/obstacles/rock) or an [Oil Tank](/obstacles/oil_tank) and "peek" your shots. This lessens the damage that you will take from your opponent while also wasting their ammo, destroying your cover.
  - Be careful against weapons with high obstacle DPS such as LMGs or some assault rifles, as they can readily destroy cover.

## Countering

- The Mosin-Nagant's biggest weakness is against shotguns in close-range combat. The shotgun's higher damage output makes it a better choice for close-up fighting.
  - Dual [Model 37s](/weapons/guns/model_37) are among the best for this.
  - The Mosin-Nagant's long barrel can also get in the way of fights that occur in tight spaces.
- Make sure to have high adrenaline and strafe the Mosin-Nagant user to try and get them to miss their shots.
- If at medium or close range, high DPS weapons other than shotguns such as the [MCX Spear](/weapons/guns/mcx_spear) or even [ARX-160](/weapons/guns/arx-160) might be able to beat the Mosin-Nagant due to its low overall DPS.
  - This works best against less-skilled players who can't aim as well.
- The [Tango 51](/weapons/guns/tango_51) is better than the Mosin-Nagant in almost every way, so it can be used as an effective counter.
- SMGs can also work against an opponent with a Mosin-Nagant if you surprise them in an ambush.

# Obtaining

The Mosin-Nagant is an uncommon drop from higher-tier crates such as the [AEGIS Crate](/obstacles/aegis_crate) and [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrop_crate). It can also be found rarely as world loot. It has a guaranteed drop chance from the [Gold Rock](/obstacles/gold_rock), which always spawns once per map.

# Trivia

- Émile Nagant's brother, Léon Nagant, designed the [M1895](/weapons/guns/m1895) revolver.
- The Mosin-Nagant is one of 7 guns that were in surviv.io, the others being the [Vector](/weapons/guns/vector), [AK-47](/weapons/guns/ak47), [USAS-12](/weapons/guns/usas12), [M1 Garand](/weapons/guns/m1_garand), [DEagle](/weapons/guns/deagle), and [VSS](/weapons/guns/vss).
  - It also the first sniper rifle added to Suroi
