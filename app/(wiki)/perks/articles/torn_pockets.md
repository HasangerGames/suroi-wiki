**Torn Pockets** is a [Perk](/perks) added in the [v0.21.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.21.0) "Plumpkin Panic" update on October 31st, 2024 that causes you to drop two of any ammo every two seconds.

# Effects

Every two seconds, two rounds of a random ammo type in your inventory are forcibly dropped on the ground. Ammo types that you have more of are more likely to be chosen.

# Obtaining
On the Halloween Map, you have a 1 in 12 chance to get the Torn Pockets perk after picking up a [Plumpkin Gamble](/perks/lets_go_gambling) perk dropped from a [Diseased Plumpkins](/obstacles/diseased_plumpkin). Diseased Pumpkins are scattered throughout the map as well as one in the [Plumpkin Bunker](/building/plumpkin_bunker).

# Strategies
## Countering
- Since this is a negative-effect perk, it is ideal to switch it out as soon as possible. This can be done by breaking some [Diseased Plumpkins](obstacles/diseased_plumpkin) and rerolling, but be aware that there is a chance you get another negative-effect perk. 
- Pick up other ammo types, even for guns you don't have, as the perk may drop that ammo instead of what your gun needs.  
- If you have a gun such as the [VKS Vykhlop](/weapons/guns/vks) and are stuck with this perk, this perk can become very annoying, as 50 Cal ammo is relatively rare. This applies to other rare-ammo guns as well. 
- Finding the [Costumed Perk](/perks/costumed) can be a lifesaver, as it will replace Torn Pockets and is the most common Perk on the Halloween Map.
