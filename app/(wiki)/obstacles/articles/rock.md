The **Rock** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) that spawns frequently around the map. It was added to the game in the [v0.1.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.1.0) "We're back, baby" update on May 20th, 2023. The Mossy Rock and the Cracked Rock are variations of the Rock but are functionally the same.

# Location & Spawning

Rocks can be found randomly spawned around the map, with no specific locations. Only 200 spawn per map.

# Loot & More

The Rock drops no loot upon being destroyed.

# Tips

- If you're low on health and have nowhere else to go, you can try hiding behind a Rock to heal and avoid bullets.
- You can hide behind this with a gun that has little range or a melee weapon to force an opponent to approach where you can get a hit on them.
- Remember that Rocks are breakable and aren't fool-proof barriers.
- If there is a river rock that an enemy is hiding behind, you can destroy it to avoid getting close to them or to stop them from healing.
- Players trying to hide behind these are often low on health and can make for easy kills.

# Trivia

- The Rock is one of the first Obstacles to be added to the game.
