The **Small House** is a building added in the [v0.11.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.11.0) "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023. It is a small and compact structure with decent loot density, perfect for getting geared up early game. The small house replaced the bigger [House](/buildings/house) that was added in v0.9.0.

# Location & Spawning

The Small House is a very common building around the map and can spawn anywhere on land. Up to 10 Small Houses attempt to spawn per map.

# Areas

## Bathroom

The Bathroom contains a single [Toilet](/obstacles/toilet). - If the Toilet has a poo in it, it likely contains guns or other weapons. - If the Toilet doesn't have a poo in it, it likely contains healing items such as [Gauze](/healing/gauze) or [Cola](/healing/cola).

Toilets have a 1/3 chance to be "used" and a 2/3 chance to spawn as a regular Toilet.

## Bedroom

The bedroom contains a [Bed](/obstacles/bed), a [Bookshelf](/obstacles/bookshelf), and a [Small Drawer](/obstacles/small_drawer).

## Foyer

The Foyer contains a [Couch](/obstacles/couch), a large [Large Drawer](/obstacles/large_drawer), and a bookshelf.

## Kitchen & Dining Area

The Kitchen contains a [Stove](/obstacles/stove) and a [Fridge](/obstacles/fridge). - Many players don't realize that the Fridge drops [2-3 Colas](/loot#fridge) when broken. Even late into game, you can often check Small Houses and still find some unbroken ones.

The Dining Area has a [Table](/obstacles/table) with two [Chairs](/obstacles/chair) and a Small Drawer by the door. - Players can hide under the Table.

# Tips

- While the Colas from the Fridge are valuable, try to find a weapon to defend yourself with first in case another player enters the Small House.
- If you have a gun with good obstacle DPS like an assault rifle or DMR, you can blow up the Stove from outside through the window.
  - This will kill or severely damage opponents.
- Use doors to block damage and frustrate your enemies.
  - The door in the Bedroom is particularly effective at this, and useful if you have no weapons.
