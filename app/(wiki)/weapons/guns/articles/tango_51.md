The **Tactical Operations Tango 51**, known in-game as the **Tango 51**, is a sniper rifle utilizing 7.62mm ammunition. It was added in the [v0.5.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.5.0) "Locked & Loaded" on June 24, 2023. It features very high damage and accuracy.

# Background

The Tango 51 is a tactical sniper rifle designed and manufactured by Tactical Operations in the 1990s. It was designed to be a lightweight, compact weapon and for use by law enforcement snipers. In testing, it had incredible accuracy and comes guaranteed with a .25" MOA. Learn more about the Tango 51 [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tango_51).

# Strategies

## Using

- Take advantage of the high accuracy, speed, and damage and snipe enemies from a distance.
  - If you are skilled enough, it can be used at close range, though this can be dangerous if your opponent possesses a high-DPS weapon such as a shotgun.
- Keep your distance by running away while shooting + quickswitching if your opponent decides to rush.
  - Make sure to quickswitch as the speed reduction after a shot can be just enough time for your opponent to gun you down and kill you.
- Don't be overconfident. While it may seem that you are unstoppable with such a powerful weapon, enemies can still catch you by surprise.

## Countering

- Don't rush your opponent directly if you plan on attacking close-range, as it makes you an easy shot. Instead, strategically move around obstacles and strafe in open spaces to minimize the number of shots your opponent hits.
- If you have another sniper rifle such as the [Mosin-Nagant](/weapons/guns/mosin), it can be used for a long-range fight between you and your opponent. Be aware that the Tango deals a lot of damage, so hide behind [Obstacles](/obstacles) and strafe whenever possible.

# Obtaining

The most reliable way to get a Tango 51 is to head for the [Ship](/buildings/ship) at the [Port](/buildings/port) at the beginning of the game, and solve the puzzle. The Tango 51 can also be found extremely rarely from common sources of loot, such as [Regular Crates](/obstacles/regular_crate). It also spawns in regular [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrop_crate).

# Trivia

- The real-life Tango 51 is actually based on the action of a Remington 700.
  - However, it is custom-made and far more precise than a standard Remington one.
