The **Вятско-Полянский машиностроительный завод Вепрь-12 (JSC Vyatskiye Polyany Molot Machine-Building Plant Vepr-12)** is an automatic shotgun utilizing the 12-gauge ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.15.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.15.0) "Pulling the Pin" update on January 14th, 2024. It has a very high damage output and is one of the best shotguns.

# Background
The Vepr-12 was originally designed by the Kalashnikov Group (then Izhmash) in the early 2000s. It was then redesigned by Molot Weapons and brought into production. To compete with the Saiga-12, new features were brought to the Vepr-12 such as an ambidextrous safety selector, a bolt hold-open mechanism, and an improved magazine feeding system. 

# Strategies
## Using
- As a shotgun, the Vepr-12 is most useful in mid-range and close-range fights.
  - It is especially good around [Buildings](/buildings) and Containers.
- The high DPS lets the Vepr-12 shred through opponents, making it very useful late game even against higher tier armor.
- Keep an eye on your reserves of 12-gauge ammunition, as the Vepr-12 burns through ammo.
- The Vepr-12 pairs well with most other guns, but it pairs especially well with long-range weapons such as snipers or LMGs.
- Try not to shoot all five rounds from your Vepr-12 when fighting an opponent. Instead, fire 2-3 bursts and switch to your secondary (such as an assault rifle or SMG), and if your opponent still isn't dead, you can fire the remaining 2-3 rounds from your Vepr-12.
- Like the [Model 37](/weapons/guns/model_37) and other shotguns, the Vepr-12 can be quickswitched. Doing so sacrifices DPS, but greatly increases mobility. Strategies are similar to those with the Model 37.
- If an opponent is hiding behind a Rock, you can shoot at the Rock and let the Vepr-12 destroy it and expose the other player. There should still be enough rounds left to kill them.

## Countering
- Since the Vepr-12 is a shotgun, you can use weapons with longer range like assault rifles to attack an opponent with a Vepr-12 and avoid taking damage.
  - Snipers and DMRs are also good options for this.
- Be careful around cover, as the Vepr-12 can tear through [Rocks](/obstacles/rock) and [Trees](/obstacles/tree) with ease.
  - You can still use cover to waste an opponent's shots, however.
- Get lots of adrenaline and strafe your opponent to make them miss their shots.
- Attack your opponent as they are reloading, as the Vepr-12 lacks the single reload of other shotguns like the Model 37 and [M3K](/weapons/guns/m3k).
- The [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues) has higher DPS than the Vepr-12, but at the cost of a smaller mag size. You could use it against a Vepr-12 user, however.

# Obtaining
The Vepr-12 can be found rarely as world loot. It is more common in higher-tier loot sources such as [Viking Chests](/obstacles/viking_chest), [Briefcases](/obstacles/briefcase), and regular [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrop_crate).

# Trivia
- This is the second automatic shotgun to be added to Suroi, after the [USAS-12](/weapons/guns/usas12).
