The **Armory** is a large structure added in the [v0.15.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.15.0) "Pulling the Pin" update on January 14th, 2024. It contains a unique weapon, the [Maul](/weapons/melee/maul), and several unique obstacles.

# Location & Spawning

One Armory attempts to spawn per map in a random position and rotation, on Normal Mode.

# Areas

The Barracks spawns in the lower left of the Armory. It contains five [Bunk Beds](/obstacles/bunk_bed), two [Cabinets](/obstacles/cabinet), two small [Drawers](/obstacles/drawers), a [Stove](/obstacles/stove), and a [Fridge](/obstacles/fridge).

## Center

The Center spawns on the right side of the Armory. It contains two [Chairs](/obstacles/chair), a [Table](/obstacles/table), a Cabinet, a small drawer, and a [Gun Mount](/obstacles/gun_mounts) always containing a [Maul](/weapons/melee/maul).

## Vault

The Vault spawns in the top left corner of the Armory. 

### Outer Vault

The outer area of the Vault contains four [Buttons](/obstacles/button), two [Gun Cases](/obstacles/gun_case), two [Ammo Crates](/obstacles/ammo_crate), a panel with no button, a [Tear Gas Crate](/obstacles/tear_gas_crate), and a [Grenade Crate](/obstacles/grenade_crate).

### Inner Vault

The inner area of the Vault can only be accessed by entering a specific password into the four buttons on the outer vault. Once the correct password is entered, the [Vault Door](/obstacles/doors) opens, allowing access to the inner Vault.

The password to the inner vault is Ã–LJY, which is Finnish for "oil". The markings on the floor determine which buttons correspond to which letter.

The inner Vault contains a [Briefcase](/obstacles/briefcase), a [Barrel](/obstacles/barrel), an Ammo Crate, and a [Regular Crate](/obstacles/crates).

## Shed

Main article: [Port Shed](/buildings/port_shed).
The Shed spawns in the lower right corner of the Armory.

## Porta Potty

Main article: [Porta Potty](/buildings/porta_potty).
The Porta Potty spawns near the exterior of the Vault.

## Other

- There is a [M1117](/obstacles/m1117) in the top right of the Armory.
  - Near it is a [Flint Crate](/obstacles/crates) and two [Gun Cases](/obstacles/gun_case) that can drop your weapons and other loot.
  - The M1117 reflects bullets, is indestructible, prevents [Frag Grenades](/weapons/throwables/frag_grenade) from flying over.
- Many [Regular Crates](/obstacles/regular_crate), [Barrels](/obstacles/barrels), [Super Barrels](/obstacles/barrels), [Sandbags](/obstacles/sandbags), [Grenade Crates](/obstacles/grenade_crate), as well as several [Tear Gas Crates](/obstacles/tear_gas_crate), [Gun Cases](/obstacles/gun_case) and [Ammo Crates](/obstacles/ammo_crate) spawn throughout the structure.
  - These obstacles can be used for cover or loot.
- A [Barrier](/obstacles/barrier) spawns behind two [Sandbags](/obstacles/sandbags) at the bottom of the Armory. It can be used as an indestructible cover from enemies.
- Most of the structure is surrounded by [Port Fences](/obstacles/port_fence).

# Tips

- Be careful as there are often many players at the Armory looking for loot.
  - Unless you spawn close to the Armory early game, don't bother heading for the Armory as it will likely already be looted by the time you arrive.
- There is plenty of indestructible cover in the Armory, such as [Sandbags](/obstacles/sandbags) and the [M1117](/obstacles/m1117), so fights in this structure often last longer.
  - However, there are plenty of explosive obstacles in the Armory such as the [Barrel](/obstacles/barrels), so don't get too comfortable.
- If you want to avoid a fight, only go to the center and Vault to get the valuable loot from the Armory, then leave immediately.

# Trivia

- In real life, an armory is a place for a military to store weapons.
