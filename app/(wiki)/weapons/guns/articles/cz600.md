The **CZ-600 Rifle**, known in-game as the **CZ-600**, is a bolt-action sniper rifle utilizing the 5.56mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the v0.16.0 "A Sailor's Dream" update on February 25, 2024. It has lower damage and range, but a shorter firing delay and less recoil compared to other sniper rifles.

# Background

The CZ-600 is a versatile firearm designed for various applications. It boasts sub-MOA accuracy, making it ideal for customization. Its lightweight aluminum receiver and semi-heavy barrel provide a balanced weight reduction suitable for field use. The rifle features a semi-cold-forged, threaded barrel with robust capabilities, alongside sling swivel studs and scope mount rails included. With a polymer stock and detachable box-style magazine, the CZ-600 promises reliability and performance for a wide range of shooting needs.

# Strategies

## Using
- Being a sniper rifle, take advantage of the high accuracy, speed, and damage for each shot to snipe enemies from a safer distance.
  - If you are skilled enough, it can be used at close-range, though this can be dangerous if your opponent possesses a weapon designed for close-range combat such as the [Model 37](/weapons/guns/model_37).
- Keep your distance by running away while shooting, as well as quickswitching if your opponent rushes you.

## Countering
- Don't rush your opponent directly. If you're planning on rushing someone with a CZ-600, move around obstacles so that it's less likely for them to hit you.
- If you have a sniper of your own, like a [Mosin-Nagant](/weapons/guns/mosin) and a large scope multiplier, you can engage them from a far distance.

# Obtaining
The CZ-600 is obtainable rarely in [Crates](/obstacles/crates). It is also able to be found in [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops), [Viking Chests](/obstacles/viking_chest), and [River Chests](/obstacles/river_chest), but it always spawns in  the [Lux Crate](/obstacles/lux_crate) located in the [Red Tugboat](/buildings/tugboat_red).
