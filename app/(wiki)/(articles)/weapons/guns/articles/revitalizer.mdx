The Revitalizer is a dev-only shotgun firing 12-gauge ammunition. It was secretly added in the v0.9.0 "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023.
While initially decreasing both the player's maximum health and adrenaline, it will increase those two greatly beyond their normal amounts if the user
kills players with it. Its effects—both positive and negative—stack in two ways; by getting multiple kills and by equipping multiple Revitalizers.

# Strategies
## Using
- Early on, pick your fights very carefully, as you only have half your normal health.
- Remember that each pellet that connects with an enemy will give back 2 health and 1.5 adrenaline. This greatly improves your longevity in fights, and should not be underestimated.
  - It also means that "chipping" your opponent (firing and only hitting a few pellets) is a viable strategy.
- Whatever you do, do <i>not</i> drop your Revitalizer if it has kills on it, because they will be lost if you do.
- Your increased speed allows you to outmaneuver enemies, either defensively or offensively.
- Even if you shouldn't be overconfident, you should also know how to abuse your boosted stats. Having almost 4 times the health of everyone else means that
  many counters that would traditionally work (like LMGs and even some assault rifles) simply cease to work.

## Countering
- Pick on low-boost players. Typically, they will play more defensively, and will be moving at regular speed. Here, you'll have 4 times their health, so almost
any weapon can take them down, even weapons traditionally countered by shotguns.
- A boosted Revitalizer player is very, very hard to take down. The only things capable of cleanly taking down a fully-boosted (whether single or double) player are
the <Link href="/weapons/guns/death_ray">Death Ray</Link> and the Large Refinery Barrel. Thus, your best option is usually to try and disengage; a 1v1 fight with a boosted Revitalizer is extremely
in favor of the Revitalizer player, and depending on how boosted they are, even 2 or 3 players might not be enough.
- Stats-wise, it's the same as the Model 37, except for the health/adren-altering things; this means that staying out of its range is a viable strategy. Just be careful, as a boosted
player may be able to close the distance

# Obtaining
As a dev-only weapon, the Revitalizer is only obtainable by developers. However, it is available on the arena and debug maps.

# Trivia
- It is a <Link href="/weapons/guns/model_37">Model 37</Link> with a pistol grip, telescoping stock and custom pump.
  - One can spot a device mounted similarly to a sight above the gun, with a red wire connecting it to an object
  fixed to the muzzle. Presumably, this device is the cause of the gun's unique properties.
- The pellets fired from this weapon always spread out in a uniformly distributed pattern.
- The effects of the Revitalizer stack if one equips multiple; here's a table showing the various combinations.
