The **Viking Chest** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) that was added in the [v0.15.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.15.0) "Pulling the Pin" update on January 14th, 2024. 

# Location & Spawning

A single Viking Chest typically spawns on the beach near the shore once per game. It is not visible on the player's minimap.

# Loot & More

The Viking Chest has decent [loot](/loot#viking_crate). It drops a [Seax](/weapons/melee/seax), 2-3 [Guns](/loot#viking_chest_guns), up to two pieces of [Equipment](/loot#special_equipment), and up to two [Scopes](/loot#special_scopes).

# Tips

- The Viking Chest can be used as cover in certain situations, but it is more worthwhile to break them for loot.
