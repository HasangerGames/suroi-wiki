**Gifts** are a type of [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.22.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.22.0) "Cold Steel" update on December 11, 2024. They almost always guarantee a reliable mid or high tier weapon when broken.

# Location & Spawning

Four (or rarely six) Gifts spawn symmetrically around the [Christmas Tree](/obstacles/christmas_tree) located at the [Christmas Camp](/buildings/christmas_camp). One additional Gift at the Christmas Camp can be found inside of a [Container](/buildings/containers) nearby.

# Loot & More

All Gifts have a chance to contain a skin and most Gifts are guaranteed to contain a weapon.

The color of the Gift determines what loot table the gift will use. Click on the Gift's name to see a full loot table.

- [Red Gifts](/loot#red_gift_normal) always drop a shotgun.

- [Blue Gifts](/loot#blue_gift_normal) always drop a weapon chambered in 7.62mm.

- [Green Gifts](/loot#green_gift_normal) always drop a weapon chambered in 5.56mm.

- [Black Gifts](/loot#black_gift_normal) have a 75% chance to drop a weapon chambered in .50 cal. Black Gifts additionally always explode when broken, dealing heavy damage to nearby players.

- [Purple Gifts](/loot#purple_gift_normal) are the rarest variant of Gifts and always drop airdrop-tier weapons.

# Tips

- Since there are always more Gifts at the Christmas Camp than guns a player can hold, you can usually still find a solid weapon to use even if you aren't the first person to arrive at the Christmas Camp.
  - This may not be the case when playing duos or squads.

# Trivia

- Gifts were supposed to be added during the 2023 winter event but weren't finished on time.
