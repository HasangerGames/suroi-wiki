The **Tear Gas Crate** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added to the game in the [v0.15.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.15.0) "Pulling the Pin" update.

# Location and Spawning

Three Tear Gas Crates spawn in the [Armory](/buildings/armory).

# Loot & More

Tear Gas Crates drop no loot when broken. When Tear Gas Crates are broken, they release Tear Gas in a similar way to [Smoke Grenades](/throwables/smoke_grenade).

# Tips

- Tear Gas depletes adrenaline rapidly when a player is inside it. 
- The Tear Gas released after Tear Gas Crates are broken can be used as a substitute for a Smoke Grenade. 
  - However, it is advised to just use Smoke Grenades since Tear Gas depletes adrenaline.
