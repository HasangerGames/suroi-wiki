The **Bush** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) that spawns frequently around the map. It was added to the game in the [v0.1.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.1.0) "We're back, baby" update on May 20th, 2023. They are mostly opaque and can be moved through. The **Blueberry Bush** is a larger and more opaque variation of the standard Bush and contains loot underneath.

# Location & Spawning

Both Bushes and Blueberry Bushes can be randomly spawned around the map, with no specific locations.

- 120 Bushes and 30 Blueberry Bushes spawn per map

# Loot & More

The Bush does not have any loot, but the Blueberry Bush has decent [loot](/loot#blueberry_bush). It spawns with [Scopes](/loot#scopes), [Armor](equipment/armor), or [Backpacks](equipment/backpacks).

# Tips

- If you're low on health and have nowhere else to go, you can try hiding in a Bush to heal.
- You can hide in a Bush with a shotgun or SMG and ambush other players as they pass.
- Remember that you aren't invisible inside a regular Bush unless you have a Ghillie suit.
  - However, since Blueberry Bushes are opaque this doesn't apply.
- If you look very closely, you can still see players in normal Bushes.
- Look out for telltale healing particles in a Bush, because it means another player is hiding.
  - Usually, players who are healing in a Bush are low on health, so this can be an easy kill.
  - Some newer players may not fully hide themselves in Bushes, and become easy targets.
- If you aren't sure where players are during the final stages of the zone, they could be hiding in Bushes. Shoot at a couple and see if a player comes out.
- Always try to pick up the loot in Blueberry Bushes, as they can have rare loot occasionally and are a good source of Healing Items.
- Be wary of the potential of [C4](/weapons/throwables/c4) in Bushes, especially if there is high-value loot around it.

# Trivia

- When Blueberry Bushes were first added, a layering bug caused players to appear on top of bushes on other players' screens.
