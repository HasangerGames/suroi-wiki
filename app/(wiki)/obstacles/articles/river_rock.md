The **River Rock** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) that spawns frequently in rivers. It was added to the game in the [v0.15.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.15.0) "Pulling the Pin" update on January 15th, 2023. It is functionally the same as the other rock variants, just larger and with more health.

# Location & Spawning

River Rocks can be found randomly spawned in the rivers, with no specific locations. Only 45 spawn per map.

# Loot & More

The River Rock drops no loot upon being destroyed.

# Tips

- If you're low on health and have nowhere else to go, you can try hiding behind this to heal and avoid bullets.
- You can hide behind this with a gun that has little range or a melee weapon to force an opponent to approach where you can get a hit on them.
- Remember that River Rocks are breakable and aren't fool-proof barriers.
- The River Rock has a lot of health, so unless you have a LMG, it's not worth trying to destroy to get an opponent hiding behind it.
- Players trying to hide behind River Rocks are often low on health and can make for easy kills.
