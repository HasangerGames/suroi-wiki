# Location & Spawning

Small Tables can be found inside of many buildings with indoor areas like the [Armory](/buildings/armory). Large Tables are found inside of the [Green House](/buildings/green_house), the [AEGIS Headquarters](/builings/headquarters), and the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta). The Round Table is only found on the back porch of the [Lodge](/buildings/lodge).

# Loot & More

All types of tables don't drop loot and don't have a collidable hitbox, which means that players and bullets pass through it.

# Tips

- Tables can make great hiding spots for using [Healing Items](/healing) or escaping from an opponent. They can also be used to surprise your opponent with a high DPS weapon.

# Trivia

- The Small Table was originally known as just the "Table" until more types of tables were added.
- The Round Table is extremely similar in size to the [Fire Pit](/obstacles/fire_pit).
