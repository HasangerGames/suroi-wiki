<Event />
**Advanced Athletics** is a [Perk](/perks) added in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. It grants a speed boost when in water or smoke, and also allows the ability phase through trees and windows.

# Effects:
When in water:
- 60% Speed increase (compared to normal water speed)
- 30% Speed increase (compared to normal land speed)

When in smoke:
- 20% Speed Increase

Ability to vault (walk through) windows as well as walk through trees.

# Obtaining
In Harvest Mode, Advanced Athletics drops from the [Plumpkin](/obstacles/plumpkin), located in the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta). Like other perks, it is occasionally dropped from [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops) and more commonly from [Gold Airdrops](/obstacles/gold_airdrop_crate).

# Strategies
## Using
- Advanced Athletics is generally a situational perk and can be extremely powerful depending on *where* the engagements you fight will take place. It's strong around smoke, water, and buildings, but can struggle in more open areas where there is only trees.
- Surprise your opponents by walking through windows, allowing unexpected routes of attack or escape.
- Use smoke and water to strafe and dodge enemy bullets using the speed boost you gain when standing in them.
  - If you need to heal, try and do it in water to counteract the slowdown from [Healing Items](/healing).
  - If you need to heal in smoke, use the speed boost to move around quicker and avoid bullets that opponents might shoot into the smoke. You can also use this to escape any [Frag Grenades](/weapons/throwables/frag_grenade) lobbed your way.
- Hide inside trees to force opponents to waste their ammunition trying to attack you.
- If an enemy is hiding on the other side of a tree, you can use a CQC weapon such as a shotgun (the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues) works really well for this) to phase through the tree and surprise them.
- During Halloween Mode, Advanced Athletics can be combined with [Lycanthropy](/perks/lycanthropy), which will make you insanely fast in water and allow you to (terrifyingly) jump through windows.
  - If you use Advanced Athletics with [Shrouded](/perks/shrouded), it grants you a permanent speed boost.

## Countering
- Be on the lookout for any players that might have Advanced Athletics, so you won't be caught off guard if they vault through a window or phase through a tree.
- Use [Frag Grenades](/weapons/throwables/frag_grenade) to attack players that are trying to hide in the trees.
- Avoid throwing down smoke if you suspect that someone might have Advanced Athletics.
  - Similarly, avoid water fights with a player that could possibly have the perk.
- Move to open land areas where there is no water or buildings that your opponent could use to their advantage.
- Other speed boost perks like [Berserker](/perks/stark_melee_gauntlet) and [Second Wind](/perks/second_wind) can keep pace with or are faster than Advanced Athletics.
