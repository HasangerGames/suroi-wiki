The **Ruger Mini-14**, known in-game as the **Mini-14**, is a DMR utilizing 5.56mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.10.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.10.0) "Back with a Bang" update on September 14th, 2023. It has decent damage, a high rate of fire, and high DPS.

# Background

The Mini-14, as the name suggests, is based on the bigger 7.62x51mm NATO firing M14. It uses a custom gas design but fires the smaller 5.56x45mm NATO or .223 Remington cartridge. Variants chambered for other calibers such as 7.62x39mm also exist. The Mini-14 was popular with police forces in the United States for many years before being largely replaced by M4-style rifles. It is still in use by a variety of police and security forces worldwide.

# Strategies

## Using

- The Mini-14 is best used at long-range, but its high DPS makes it effective against many weapons at mid-range as well.
- Stay at long range, as the high accuracy and fast bullet speed make the Mini-14 very powerful against other long-range weapons like snipers and the [MCX Spear](/weapons/guns/mcx_spear).
- The [SR-25](/weapons/guns/sr25) has more damage and DPS compared to the Mini-14 and is an effective counter against the Mini-14.
- Pair the Mini-14 with a high-DPS shotgun or SMG for close-range combat.

## Countering

- Use high adrenaline and strafe the Mini-14 user, as the low spread makes it easier to dodge the bullets.
- Despite the Mini-14 having very good obstacle DPS, you can still use cover like [Rocks](/obstacles/rock) and [Trees](/obstacles/tree) as a last resort to waste the opponent's ammo and attack while they are reloading.
- High-DPS weapons such as SMGs and shotguns can beat the Mini-14 at close range.
  - Hide around indestructible obstacles such as [Oil Tanks](/obstacles/oil_tank) or in [Buildings](/buildings) to force the Mini-14 user into close-range combat.
  - Be careful, however, as they might have a shotgun or SMG of their own as a secondary weapon.
- At long-range, snipers can be effective against the Mini-14, provided that you quickswitch to move around quicker.
- The [MCX Spear](/weapons/guns/mcx_spear) has a higher DPS and comparable accuracy to the Mini-14, and can be used as a counter. However, it has less damage per magazine which means you will reload frequently.

# Obtaining

A Mini-14 always spawns on a [Gun Mount](/obstacles/gun_mounts) in the security room vault on the first floor of the [Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters). The Mini-14 additionally can be found rarely as world loot and uncommonly from special loot sources such as from [AEGIS](/obstacles/aegis_crate) and [Flint Crates](/obstacles/flint_crate), or from the center of a [Warehouse](/buildings/warehouse).

# Trivia

- The reference image for the Mini-14 is one of the developer's own Mini-14.
- The in-game Mini-14 is most likely the "Ranch" variant, which is the most basic configuration.
