# Developing

Thank you for considering to contribute code to the Suroi wiki!

If you find any bugs errors, or inconsistencies in general in the wiki, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi-wiki/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi-wiki/pulls) at the [github repository](https://github.com/HasangerGames).

We use the following tech stack:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [React](https://react.dev)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

Please refer to the documentation of each framework / library for more information.

## Getting Started

This wiki utilizes [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), so first-time setup for a development environment is slightly different from normal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi-wiki.git --recursive
cd suroi-wiki
pnpm i
```

### Local Development
To start a local development server, run `pnpm dev`, then go to `https://127.0.0.1:3000` in your browser (A different port maybe be used if 3000 is being used).

### Production
To build for production, run `pnpm build`. To start the server, run `pnpm start`.

Note that we use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io), a high-performance alternative to [npm](https://npmjs.com).

## Recommended Setup

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) / [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com)
- VSCode Extensions (VSCode should automatically recommend you workspace extensions)
  - TypeScript
  - ESLint
  - Prettier
  - Code Spell Checker
  - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
- [git](https://git-scm.com)

**NOTE:** These are just recommendations. Feel free to use whatever tools suit you best.

### Pre-Commit Hooks

If you have been plagued by GitHub spamming your email about failed CI runs, try out [Git Hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)!

At the project root:

```sh
echo "pnpm lint; pnpm spellcheck" > .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Now Git will **automatically** lint and spellcheck for you on each commit!

## DO's and DON'Ts

**DON'T use `<a></a>` and `<img />`**

We use the NextJS component equivalents, `<Link></Link>` and `<Image />`.

**DON'T push large amounts of changes to the wiki code**

Please make a branch / fork and create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). Also have at **least one** maintainer review your code.<br/>
Small changes are an exception to this and don't need review (though it is best to get approval from @kenos1 (kenos) or @Compositr).

**DON'T ignore the JSX key error**

It's super annoying, but add a `key` prop anyways.

**DON'T push hacky solutions**

The only exception is if it will be refactored soon, or if another person is willing to refactor it.

**DON'T use external images**

Currently, the only exceptions to this rule are [GitHub](https://github.com) for game assets and [Invidious](https://invidious.io) for YouTube thumbnails.<br/>Please upload any other assets in `/public`.

**DON'T use emojis in commit messages**

You **will** be publicly shamed.

**DO use tree shaking**

If you are adding new libraries, please use tree shaking whenever possible, to minimize bundle sizes.

**DO use a formatter and linter**

Execute this command to run ESLint over the codebase:

```sh
pnpm lint
```

**DO use a spellchecker**

Run this command to spellcheck:

```sh
pnpm spellcheck
```

  Note that we run GitHub Actions to check for build errors, linting, and
  spellchecking!
