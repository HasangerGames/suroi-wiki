Trees are a type of obstacle that spawn frequently on the map. They were added to the game in the [v0.1.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.1.0) "We're back, baby" update on May 20th, 2023, and come in six variants.

# Location & Spawning

Trees are extremely common obstacles and can spawn just about anywhere on the map. On the Normal Map, Small Oak Trees are the most common type of tree. Birch Trees, Pine Trees, and Large Oak Trees are rarer. Maple Trees and Dormant Oak Trees only spawn on the Harvest and Halloween Maps.

# Loot & More

Trees drop no loot upon being broken.

# Tips

- Trees make decent cover from enemies.
  - Pine Trees are almost 100% opaque, making a very good hiding spot if you need to heal or prepare a surprise attack.
  - Birch Trees have higher health, allowing you to buy more time or force your opponent to waste additional ammo.
  - Small Oak Trees are the most common type of tree on the Normal Map but offer no statistical or visual benefits.
  - Large Oak Trees cover a large area and are mostly opaque. They can be used in a similar fashion as a smoke grenade.
  - Dormant Oak Trees aren't as ideal for cover as they have lower health than any other tree variant and also have very poor visual cover. They only spawn on the Harvest and Halloween maps.
  - Maple Trees are much larger and have higher health and visual cover, but also only spawn on the Harvest and Halloween Maps.
  - However, all six variants can be easily destroyed with any high-DPS weapon in a matter of seconds.
- If your opponent is hiding behind a Tree to avoid shots or heal up, just shoot the Tree down. They have low health and are easy to destroy.
- In the end game, campers may hide in the overlapping area of two Trees or a single Tree if they have a skin that helps camouflage them or the Tree has good visual cover (usually only Oak and maple Trees). Shoot a bullet or two into these areas to chase any remaining players out.
