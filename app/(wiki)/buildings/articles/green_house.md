# Green House



The Green House is a relatively new building that drops decent loot, especially with the recent buff of the HP-18.



# Location & Spawning



In most maps, 2-4 Green Houses spawn, though that number can vary. Often, players spawn somewhat close to a Green House, and the guaranteed weapon drop makes it an attractive location. 











# Loot & More



The Green House has a 100% chance to drop an [HP-18](/guns/hp18) next to the front entrance. It also has a few [Large Drawers](/obstacles/large_drawer) and a [Bookshelf](/obstacles/bookshelf). Both of these have a somewhat high chance to drop a gun, so break these first so you can go into battle. 







# Tips



- When coming in through the main entrance, loot the [HP-18 Gun Mount](/obstacles/gun_mount_hp18) so you can kill other players if they come in. 



- [Potted Plants](/obstacles/potted_plant) usually drop ammo or heals - but no guns.



- This is one of the most loot-dense houses in the game, so if you spawn late, it is unlikely it will be untouched. 



- Use the skylights and broken roof to check if there are players inside - but be careful, because they may be able to see you as well. 



- The covered entrance in the front of the house can be used to ambush players with as you are hidden from the other players' view. The [Flues](/guns/flues) or [Model 37](/guns/model_37) are good options for this. 
  - Note that your opponent might creep up to you from the side with another high-DPS weapon, so this is not a free-kill strategy.







# Trivia



 - This is the biggest house in the game



 - In v.11, the [TV](/obstacles/tv) and [Washing Machine](/obstacles/washing_machine) were removed - but 6 versions later, they were readded. In fact, hasanger foreshadowed this, saying "The big variant will be overhauled and re-added in a future update.".

- Platonthek designed the Green House
