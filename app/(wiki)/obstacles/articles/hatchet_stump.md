The **Hatchet Stump** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) that only spawns on the Harvest and Halloween Maps and was added alongside the Harvest Map in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. It is a rare variant of the [Stump](/obstacles/stump).

# Location & Spawning

Three Hatchet Stumps spawn across the Harvest and Halloween Maps in random locations.

# Loot & More

The Hatchet Stump always drops a single [Hatchet](/weapons/melee/hatchet).

# Tips

- Similar to normal stumps, Hatchet Stumps have 180 health, so they can be used as cover against opponents with weaker weapons.
  - However, as long as there are no enemies around it is recommended for you to break the Hatchet Stump immediately because the Hatchet is one of the best melee weapons in the game.
