Headquarters**, or **Headquarters**, is a large structure added in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) "High Caliber Negotiations" update on Sepetember 22nd, 2024.

# Location & Spawning
The Headquarters attempts to spawn once per map, anywhere on the map.

# Areas
## Ground Floor
The ground floor, or first floor, contains a large number of cubicles, a bathroom, and kitchen. There is a closet near the stairs as well as a unlockable vault adjacent to the main entrance. Using stairs, you can access the second floor.

## Vault
The Vault can only be accessed by activating the secret code.

Near the door of the Vault is a piece of paper with some ammunition on it. There is a button with the same symbol on the console near the front of the room. Use this button to unlock the Vault.

Inside the Vault, there always spawns two [Boxes](/obstacles/box), two [Gun Locker](/obstacles/gun_locker), and a [Mini-14](/weapons/guns/mini14) on a wall mount. The Gun Lockers are only breakble with an armor piercing melee weapon.

## Second Floor
On the second floor of the Headquarters, you can find a personal office, an entertainment room with a piano and a speaker, and a conference room containing the [Falchion](/weapons/melee/falchion). There is also a Secret Room accessible from both the entertainment room and the personal office. 

## Secret Room
In the black space between the entertainment room and the personal office, there is a hidden area. There are two ways to enter the Secret Room. The first is by breaking the [Filing Cabinet](/obstacles/filing_cabinet) in the personal office, and the second is by breaking the couch in the entertainment room. Inside the Secret Room is the [Golden AEGIS Case](/obstacles/aegis_golden_case), which has a:

# Tips
- As the game's currently largest single building, the Headquarters usually had a lot of players converging on it.
- The Headquarters includes a lot of areas suitable for CQC weapons like SMGs and Shotguns.
 - LMGs can be useful in certain areas such as the cubicles for destroying cover.
- If you hear the music from upstairs, there's a good chance the Golden AEGIS Case has already been looted.
- Try to get weapons before entering the Headquarters, to defend yourself better.
- If you come through the main entrance, going into the Vault can be a good option to quickly get a decent gun or two and some supplies.
- Players entering from the inside staircase may want to loot the conference room first, as it contains a lot of loot as well as the Falchion, before tackling the Secret Room.
- If you're entering on the outside staircase, your best bet is to get into the Secret Room through the couch.
- The metal detectors can be very useful for letting you know when players have entered/exited the building even if you haven't seen them.
  - You can place [C4](/weapons/throwables/c4) under the metal detectors to try and catch unsuspecting players. Simply trigger it when you hear the beep.
- "The pass" (where food is taken from kitchen to the table), or the area between the kitchen and the rest of the building, can be fired through with guns as it is a gap in the wall. Many players don't realize this and think they are safe behind this "wall".
