The **Heckler & Koch MG5**, known in-game as the **MG5**, is an LMG utilizing the 7.62mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.17.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.17.0) "Just the Two of Us" update on March 31st, 2024. The MG5 has a steady fire rate and great damage output.

# Background
The MG5 is based on a similar design to that of the MG4 light machine gun that preceded it, with some changes to make it more suited to firing the heavier 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge. The gun is quite accurate for a general-purpose machine gun. It is used by a variety of military units around the world and has been produced since 2015.

# Strategies
## Using
- Try to find a good scope. The MG5 is more accurate than many weapons in Suroi, so make sure to take advantage of this.
- Reload whenever you're not in combat.
  - Not only will this give you a full magazine to work with, it also frees up more space in your pack for ammunition.
  - The MG5 has the second longest reload of any weapon, so reload out of combat and avoid reloading in combat if possible.
  - If you find an MG5 but have no backpack, reload multiple times to carry as much ammo as possible, since you don't want to run out.
- Because it is more accurate, (albeit with slightly lower DPS) the MG5 is more suited to long-range combat than its competitor, the [Negev](/weapons/guns/negev).
- If your enemy is far away, such as 8x range, move closer so you can kill them more easily and not waste ammo.
- The MG5 has a 2x obstacle multiplier, meaning it shreds through obstacles. If an opponent hides behind a destructible obstacle, don't hesitate to plow right through it.
- Because the MG5 is so rare, it can be used to bait players by leaving it on the ground.
  - Be wary of an MG5 as a ground, as it might be a trap and a player could be hiding nearby to ambush you.
- Don't openly hold the MG5 when not in combat. It has a large slowdown and makes you a prime target to others due to the distinctive world image.

## Countering
- At close and mid range, the [Negev](/weapons/guns/negev) is a direct counter to the MG5 due to its higher DPS.
- If you see an enemy reloading, take advantage of their vulnerability by rushing them with a shotgun or other high-DPS weapon like an SMG.
- Make sure to find indestructible cover such as a [Buildings](/buildings), Container, or [Oil Tank](/obstacles/oil_tank).
  - If you see or hear shots, try not to stay out in the open and find cover.
- Use lots of adrenaline and strafe the opponent to dodge bullets.
  - This is effective at wasting entire magazines and taking little damage if the opponent is fairly unskilled.
- Another high-DPS weapon such as, [MCX Spear](/weapons/guns/mcx_spear) or a [Mini-14](/weapons/guns/mini14) can catch an MG5 user off-guard if they are reloading or out in the open.
- Waste your opponent's ammunition by dodging and hiding behind cover.

# Obtaining
The most common way to find an MG5 is through a [Gold Airdrop](/obstacles/gold_airdrop_crate) or by breaking a [Flint Stone](/obstacles/flint_stone). It can also spawn very rarely as world loot.

# Trivia
- In real life, the MG5 is classified as a GPMG (General Purpose Machine Gun), but it is a LMG in Suroi for simplicity.
- The MG5 is one of two guns (the other being the [Negev](/weapons/guns/negev)) in Suroi that utilizes a belt feed system.
