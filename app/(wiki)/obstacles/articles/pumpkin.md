The **Pumpkin** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) that only spawns on the Harvest and Halloween Maps. It was added to the game in the [v0.12.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.12.0) "Trick-or-Tweak" update on October 29th, 2023. It is a very common obstacle on both the Harvest and Halloween Maps.

# Location & Spawning

200 Pumpkins spawn around the Harvest and Halloween Maps in random locations.

# Loot & More

The Pumpkin drops common loot similar to crates such as ammo and guns.

# Tips

- The small size and relatively low health of the Pumpkin make it a poor choice for cover.
