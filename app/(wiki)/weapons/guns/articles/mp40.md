The **MP 40 (Maschinenpistole 40)**, known in-game as the **MP40**, is a SMG utilizing 9mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.8.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.8.0) "Untrodden Lands" update on July 17th, 2023. It has decent DPS and very good accuracy for an SMG.

# Background

The MP 40 was designed by Heinrich Vollmer, taking inspiration from the MP 38. It was essentially a simplified version, using stamped steel instead of machined parts. Thus, it was cheap to produce and was used by the Axis powers as a paratrooper weapon as well as a sidearm for armored vehicles. The MP 40 itself was fairly reliable, but the 32-round magazines it came with often had feeding issues. After WW2, most MP 40s were captured and distributed by the Allies to developing countries.

# Strategies

## Using

- The MP40 is a useful early game against unarmored players or players with lower tier [Armor](/equipment/armor). However, later in a round, it becomes less effective due to the lower DPS and better armors of other players. It is a good idea to replace the MP40 with an assault rifle such as the [AK-47](/weapons/guns/ak47) or [AUG](/weapons/guns/aug).
- Try and get a 4x or 8x scope, as you can then take advantage of the MP40's good accuracy.
- The common 9mm ammunition is plentiful early-game, which makes the MP40 a decent pick.
- You can pair the MP40 with a shotgun for an effective early-game combo. Use the shotgun for close-range, and the MP40 for long-range or to finish off your opponent.

## Countering

- Assault rifles, DMRs, and LMGs are all effective counters to the MP40, as they have higher damage and more DPS than the more common MP40.
  - SMGs such as the [SAF-200](/weapons/guns/saf200) or [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi) can also work when used properly.
  - Pistols can also work, but be careful, as they may be even worse than the MP40.
  - Snipers can outrange the MP40 and do much more damage. Make sure to quickswitch to maintain mobility.
- Shotguns work very well against an MP40 user at close range.
- Stay behind cover such as [Rocks](/obstacles/rock) and [Trees](/obstacles/tree), as the MP40 has very low obstacle DPS and will burn up lots of ammo trying to destroy it.
- Despite many weapons being better than the MP40, don't underestimate it, as it is still deadly even late-game in the right hands.

# Obtaining

The MP40 is an extremely common drop from [Regular Crates](/obstacles/regular_crate) as well as [Flint](/obstacles/flint_crate)/[AEGIS Crates](/obstacles/aegis_crate) and is overall one of the most easily obtainable guns in the game.

# Trivia

- Prior to [v0.9.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.9.0), the MP40 had a 30-round magazine.
  - This is incorrect because the real-life MP40 uses 32-round magazines.
