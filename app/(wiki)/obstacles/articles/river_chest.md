# Location & Spawning

Only one River Chest spawns per game in one of the rivers generated on the map. It cannot be seen on the minimap, similar to the [Viking Chest](/obstacles/viking_chest).

# Loot & More

The River Chest drops high quality weapons. See the River Chest Guns & River Chest loot tables in the [loot](/loot) page.

# Tips

- The River Chest has poor health so it is not recommended for cover from gun fire.
  - It's better to break this chest because it has good loot.
