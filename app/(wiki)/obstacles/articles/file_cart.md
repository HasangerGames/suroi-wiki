The **File Cart** is an obstacle added in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) “High-Caliber Negotiations” update on September 22, 2024.

# Location & Spawning  

Several File Carts spawn in the [AEGIS Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters) and in the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta).

# Loot & More  

The File Cart is a metal obstacle and reflects bullets. It drops nothing upon being broken.

# Tips  

- You can use the reflective property of the File Cart to damage an opponent that isn't in a direct line of sight. Additionally, it is also possible to trick your opponent into shooting themselves. 
  - However, the File Cart has somewhat low health and is often destroyed quickly so this strategy cannot be utilized infinitely.
- The large hitbox of the File Cart allows it to be used as cover inside of the Headquarters and Plumpkin Bunker.
