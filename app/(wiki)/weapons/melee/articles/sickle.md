The **Sickle** is a melee weapon added in the [v0.18.2](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.18.2) "Pulling the Pin" update on July 4th, 2024.

# Background

The Sickle is a one-handed tool used for agricultural purposes. It features a curved blade which enables it to harvest crops effectively. A user should swing the sickle against the base of a crop, capturing the crops in a curved area (to maximize efficiency) and slicing them. Sickles are very old tools; there are surviving examples of the Sickle from the Epipalaeolithic Era, which was over 10000 years ago. Although not designed to be one, the Sickle has been used as a weapon in Southeast Asia. For example, The Celurit, a tool native to Indonesia and similar to the Sickle, is used not only as a farming tool but also as a defensive weapon.

# Strategies

## Using

- The Sickle has the highest DPS out of all melees currently in the game, beating out both the [Maul](/weapons/melee/maul) and the [Hatchet](/weapons/melee/hatchet).
  - This means in a melee fight you will likely win against your opponent as long as you are sustaining a high click rate.
- However, the Sickle's single hit damage is on the lower side which can make it harder to break obstacles with compared to other melees. Additionally, the mediocre hitbox radius of the Sickle can make it hard to consistently hit players with.

## Countering

- As with all melee weapons, the best way to avoid them entirely is to keep your distance and use a gun designed for mid or long-range combat to kill them.
  - Use a high-DPS weapon like the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues) to shoot down the Sickle user approaching you if you can't escape.
- Overall, the Sickle is a strong melee weapon due to the high DPS so make sure you don't get too close to someone with a Sickle as it can be very hard to escape their range once you are in it.

# Obtaining

The Sickle is usually obtained from [Melee Crates](/obstacles/melee_crate) and [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops). It can also be found from common loot sources such as [Regular Crates](/obstacles/regular_crate), but this is rare.
