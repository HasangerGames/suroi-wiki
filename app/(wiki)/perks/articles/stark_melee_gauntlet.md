**Berserker** is a [Perk](/perks) added in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. It grants a speed boost when holding a [Melee Weapon](/weapons/melee), as well as increasing any melee damage done. 

# Effects
When any melee weapon is equipped:
- 30% Speed increase 
- 30% Damage increase 

# Obtaining 
In Harvest Mode, Berserker drops from the [Plumpkin](/obstacles/plumpkin), located in the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta). It is also occasionally dropped from [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops) and always from [Gold Airdrops](/obstacles/gold_airdrop_crate).

# Strategies
## Using
- Berserker is one of the strongest perks available on the Harvest Map, so it is worth choosing over many others.
- If you have a shotgun, sniper, or any other gun that you can quickswitch with, you can equip your melee and then quickly shoot your gun, then switch back to your melee. This allows you to move around and shoot very fast.
  - Shotguns especially pair really well with Berserker.
- Rush your opponent with Berserker if you have a good [Melee Weapon](/weapons/melee) and decent [Armor](/equipment/armor).
- Make sure to have adrenaline on hand to enhance the effect of your speed boost.
- If you're low on health, you can use Berserker's speed boost to escape the fight.
- During Halloween Mode, Berserker synergizes extremely well with [Lycanthropy](/perks/lycanthropy), as it makes the melee damage and speed even greater than it normally is.
  - It also works very with [Bloodthirst](/perks/bloodthirst) and [Experimental Treatment](/perks/experimental_treatment), as both can provide speed and adrenaline boosts.
  - [Shrouded](/perks/shrouded) can make you more difficult to fight back against.

## Countering
- Because it has advantages both close up and at range, Berserker is an extremely difficult perk to counter.
- If your opponent is not very skilled at melee, and you have a powerful melee such as the [Maul](/weapons/melee/maul), you may be able to out-damage them and win a melee battle.
- Keep your adrenaline up to gain as much speed as possible from it.
- If your opponent is using a DMR or automatic weapon such as the [USAS-12](/weapons/guns/usas12), this makes a lot easier to fight because they have to spam the weapon and can't take advantage of the speed boost.
- Attack while your opponent is reloading, as they are forced to have their gun out and loose the speed boost.
