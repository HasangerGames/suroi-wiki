The **Tactical Operations Tango 51**, known in-game as the **Tango 51**, is a sniper rifle utilizing 7.62mm ammunition. It was added in the v0.5.0 "Locked & Loaded" on June 24, 2023. It features very high damage and accuracy.

# Background
The Tango 51 is a tactical sniper rifle designed and manufactured by Tactical Operations in the 1990's. It was designed to be a lightweight, compact weapon and for use by law enforcement snipers. In testing, it had incredible accuracy, and comes guaranteed with a .25" MOA.

# Strategies
## Using
- Take advantage of the high accuracy, speed, and damage and snipe enemies from a distance. 
  - If you are skilled enough, it can be used in close range, though this can be dangerous if your opponent possesses a high dps weapon such as a shotgun.
- Keep your distance by running away while shooting + quickswitching if your opponent decides to rush. 
  - Make sure to quickswitch as the speed reduction after a shot can be just enough time for your opponent to gun you down and kill you.
- Don't be overconfident. While it may seem that you are unstoppable with such a powerful weapon, enemies can still catch you by surprise.

## Countering
- Don't rush your opponent directly if you plan on attacking close-range as it makes you an easy shot. Instead, strategically move around obstacles and strafe in open spaces to minimize the number of shots your opponent hits.
- If you have another sniper rifle such as the [Mosin-Nagant](/weapons/guns/mosin), it can be used for a long range fight between you and your opponent. Be aware that the Tango deals a lot of damage, so hide behind obstacles and strafe whenever possible.

# Obtaining
The most reliable way to get a Tango 51 is to head for the ship on the docks structure during the beginning of the game. After collecting the gas can on the ship, use the generator to open the vault. There will either be a crate that contains up to two Tango 51's or an A.E.G.I.S. crate. The Tango 51 can also be found extremely rarely from common sources.

# Trivia
- The real-life Tango 51 is actually based on the action of a Remington 700
  - However it is custom-made and far more precise than a standard Remington one
