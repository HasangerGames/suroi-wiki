**Kitchen Units** are a type of [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. They come in three variants.

# Location & Spawning

Currently, all three Kitchen Units are only found in the kitchen of the [Lodge](/buildings/lodge).

# Loot & More

All types of Kitchen Units can drop ammunition and healing but the first and second variants can also drop [guns](/weapons). See the [loot tables](/loot#kitchen_unit_1_normal) for more information.

# Tips

- The Kitchen Units are one of the more valuable loot sources in the Lodge due to their high chance of dropping healing items and are often broken along with the [Fridge](/obstacles/fridge) nearby.  

# Trivia

- Visually, the third Kitchen Unit variant is extremely similar to the [Sink](/obstacles/sink).
