**Chairs** are a type of [Obstacle](/obstacles) in Suroi. The Normal Chair was added in the [v0.9.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.9.0) "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023 and the Office Chairs were added in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) “High-Caliber Negotiations” update on September 22nd, 2024.

# Location & Spawning

Normal Chairs can be found in many structures and often facing a [Table](/obstacles/tables). Red Office Chairs are slightly less prelevant but can still be found in many structures such as the [Tugboats](/buildings/tugboats) and [Large Tents](/buildings/tents). Grey Office Chairs are the rarest type of Chair and are only found in certain areas of the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta) and [AEGIS Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters).

# Loot & More

Chairs drop no loot when broken.

# Tips

- Since Chairs are often found near Tables, you can use them as cover if you are hiding under a Table. However, Chairs have low health, so they can't be used for very long as they will be broken quickly by most weapons.
