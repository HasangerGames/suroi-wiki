The **Maul** is a weapon that was added in the v0.9.0 "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 31, 2023. It was first made obtainable in the v0.15.0 "Pulling the Pin" update on January 15, 2024.

# Background

The maul is a long-handled hammer with a heavy head of wood, lead, iron, or steel. It functions and appears just like a sledgehammer. Sometimes a spear-like spike is on the fore-end of the head. The creator of the maul is not known. It was mainly known to appear at the late 14th century. In modern times, the maul is mostly used to split wood.

# Strategies

## Using 

- Try getting close to your opponent without losing too much health, then use the one tap clicking method when you're close enough. The Maul is also one of the melees with higher damage.
  - It's not advised to rush someone with the Maul if they have a weapon as the Maul has a long cooldown.
- Using the Maul to kill your opponent requires skill at dodging and good reaction time if your opponent changes the direction they move in often.

## Countering 

- As with all melee weapons, the best way to avoid them entirely is to keep your distance and use a gun designed for mid or long range combat to kill them.
 - If you see player who has a Maul and is rushing you, you can retaliate by keeping your distance while gunning them down.
  - If you don't feel confident in combating a Maul, just run away. They should eventually stop chasing you or just switch weapons.

# Obtaining 

The Maul can only be obtained from the [Maul Mount](/obstacles/gun_mounts) in the [Armory Center](/buildings/armory_meta).
