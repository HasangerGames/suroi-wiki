The **Generator** is an interactive [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.11.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.11.0) "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023.

# Location & Spawning

The Generator always spawns near the front of the [Ship](/buildings/ship) next to the vault.

# Loot & More

The Generator is indestructible and therefore drops no loot. When interacting with a [Gas Can](/weapons/melee/gas_can), it opens the vault, allowing access to the loot inside.

# Tips

- The Generator doesn't make an effective cover due to its positioning.

# Trivia

- The Generator was designed by platonthek
- In real life, Generators are machines that convert potential, kinetic, or chemical energy into electricity. The Generator in Suroi is a fuel-based generator since it requires gas to operate, learn more about generators [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_generator).
- The sounds for the Generator came from a Yanmar 3TNA72UJ3 3-cylinder Diesel engine inside a John Deere 455.
  - This engine produces 22 hp, or 16.4kW of power.
