The **Speaker** is an indestructible obstacle added in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) “High-Caliber Negotiations” update on September 22nd, 2024. It is located in the [AEGIS Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters).

# Location & Spawning  

The only Speaker in the game can be found next to the [Piano](/obstacles/piano) in the lounge on the second floor of the Headquarters.

# Loot & More  

Upon interacting with the Speaker in the Headquarters, a cursed version of the main menu theme of Suroi will play. The Speaker cannot be paused in any way once it has been interacted with.

# Tips  

- Depending on your playstyle, you may want to trigger the Speaker in order to attract players upstairs so that you can get more kills.
