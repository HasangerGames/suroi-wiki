**Field Medic** is a [Perk](/perks) added in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. It speeds up the usage of [Healing Items](/healing) as well as the time it takes to revive teammates.

# Effects
- 33.3% Faster time for using [Healing Items](/healing) and reviving teammates.

# Obtaining
In Harvest Mode, Field Medic drops from the [Plumpkin](/obstacles/plumpkin), located in the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta). Like other perks, it is occasionally dropped from [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops) and more commonly from [Gold Airdrops](/obstacles/gold_airdrop_crate).

# Strategies
## Using
- Make sure to stock up on lots of Healing Items, especially [Gauze](/healing/gauze). Because it can be used so quickly, you can can easily top off 20 health in a fight.
- Field Medic is much better in team modes such as Duos and Squads, as the faster reviving is not applicable in Solos.
- [Medikits](/healing/medikit) are much easier to use if you have Field Medic.

## Countering
- Field Medic does not provide any stat boosts that will help your opponent kill you faster, so don't be hesitant to engage them.
- Keep up pressure on your opponent, which won't give them the opportunity to heal.
- Your opponent could get cocky and attempt to heal or use adrenaline out in the open. If they do, attack them and punish them for making that mistake.
- In Duos or Squads, if you suspect one member of the enemy team has Field Medic, try and take them out first so they can't revive the rest of their team faster.
