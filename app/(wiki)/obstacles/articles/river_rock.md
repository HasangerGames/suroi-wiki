The **River Rock** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) that spawn frequently in the rivers. It was added to the game in the [v0.15.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.15.0) "Pulling the pin" update on January 15th, 2023. This is functionally the same as the other rock variants, just bigger than them.

# Location & Spawning

River Rocks can be found randomly spawned in the rivers, with no specific locations. Only 45 spawn per map.

# Loot & More

The River Rock drops no loot upon being destroyed.

# Tips

- If you're low on health and have nowhere else to go, you can try hiding behind this to heal and avoid bullets.
- You can hide behind this with a gun that has little range or a melee weapon to force an opponent to approach where you can get a hit on them.
- Remember that Rocks are breakable and aren't fool-proof barriers.
- If there is a river rock that an enemy is hiding behind, you can destroy it to avoid getting close to them or to stop them from healing.
- Players trying to hide behind rocks are often low on health and can make for easy kills.

# Trivia
