The **Tugboat** is a building added in the [v0.16.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.16.0) "A Sailor's Dream" update on February 26th, 2024. It comes in two variants: White Tugboats and Red Tugboats.

# Location & Spawning

Five White Tugboats and one Red Tugboat spawn in the water bordering the map. They spawn at random distances from the shore.

# Areas

## Exterior

All tugboats contain one [Grenade Crate](/obstacles/grenade_crate), one [Barrel](/obstacles/barrel), two [Regular Crates](/obstacles/crates), and six [Tires](/obstacles/tire) in the exterior portion of the boat.

## Cabin

The Cabin can be accessed through a [Door](/obstacles/doors) in the center of the boat.

All tugboat cabins contain one [Tugboat Control Panel](/obstacles/tugboat_control_panel), one [Office Chair](/obstacles/office_chair), one [Large Drawer](/obstacles/drawers) and one [Life Preserver](/obstacles/life_preserver). Additionally, White Tugboats contain a [Gun Case](/obstacles/gun_case) and Red Tugboats contain a [Lux Crate](/obstacles/lux_crate) inside the cabin. The Lux Crate drops a guaranteed [CZ-600](/weapons/guns/cz600) and a scope.

# Tips

- The water near Tugboats are not good places to fight as the water can slow you down, making you an easy target for a player who out-scopes you.
- Prioritize looting the structure with maximum efficiency and leaving as quickly as possible to minimize the chance to run into another player.
- If you do happen to end up in a fight, the metal fences on the side of the Tugboat provide indestructible cover and also reflects bullets.
- Do not go for the Red Tugboat if you spawn late into the game, as it will likely already be looted.

# Trivia

- The Tugboats were designed by Platonthek and Emeraldneo
- In real life, tugboats are a type of boat that is usually used to move other vessels out of dangerous or crowded by using a tow line. Earlier versions were powered by steam engines, which have now been replaced by diesel engines.
