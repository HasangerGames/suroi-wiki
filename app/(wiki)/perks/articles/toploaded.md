**Toploaded** is a [Perk](/perks) added in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. 

# Effects
- 25% Damage increase to the first 20% of magazine
- 10% Damage increase to the next 29% of magazine
- 0% Damage increase to the remaining 51% of magazine

# Obtaining
In Harvest Mode, Toploaded drops from the [Plumpkin](/obstacles/plumpkin), located in the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta). It is also occasionally dropped from [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops) and always from [Gold Airdrops](/obstacles/gold_airdrop_crate).

# Strategies
## Using
- Reload extra often when using Toploaded, to make the most out of your damage boost.
- Low magazine capacity and high-damaging weapons such as snipers (particularly the [L115A1](/weapons/guns/l115a1)) and shotguns work well with Toploaded, as the damage boost is more meaningful.

## Countering
- Press your opponent much more often if you know they have Toploaded, as forcing them to empty their magazine and reload will ruin their damage boost.
- Since your opponent might try reloading more often, try and attack them while they are reloading.
