The **Ithaca Gun Company Flues Double-Barrel Trap**, known in-game as the **Flues**, is a double-barrel shotgun utilizing 12-gauge ammunition. It was added to the game in the v0.12.0 "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023.

# Background
The Flues gets its name from designer Emil Flues, who worked for Ithaca Gun Company from approximately 1906 to 1915. It had a reliable design and was easy to cock with a short hammer fall. About 223,000 were made between 1908 and 1926, in a variety of gauges.

# Strategies
## Using
- The Flues can only hold two rounds, so if you only have 1 loaded, make sure to reload as soon as you can.
  - Take cover if reloading in the middle of a fight.
- If you hit both shots, it will kill or seriously weaken an opponent. Carry a secondary weapon to finish them off.
- Have a long-range weapon as your secondary to balance out the Flues' short range.
- Camp in entrances to buildings or in bushes to ambush enemies.
- Be very careful with your shots, as the Flues does not tolerate errors with only 2 rounds.
- The Flues is very dangerous when the circle is very small or in tight spaces such as buildings.

## Countering
- The Flues has the shortest range of any shotgun, tied with the <Link href="/weapons/guns/hp18">hp18</Link>, so don't get too close.
  - Use a longer range weapon such as an assault rifle or DMR.
- If the Flues user fires both of their shots, take advantage of the long reload time and attack while they are vulnerable.
- Depending on the opponent's skill, they miss one or both their shots. Strafe them and try and make them miss, then attack while they reload.
- Be wary of bushes and entrances to buildings if you suspect someone is camping.

# Rarity
The Flues is currently the rarest shotgun in the game. It is about 5 times as rare as the <Link href="/weapons/guns/m3k">M3K</Link> and the same level rarity as the <Link href="/weapons/guns/arx160">ARX-160</Link> in normal
