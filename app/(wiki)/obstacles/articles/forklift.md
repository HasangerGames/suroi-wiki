The **Forklift** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.11.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.11.0) "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023.

# Location & Spawning

The Forklift always spawns inside [Port Warehouses](/buildings/port_warehouse) as well as around the rest of the [Port](/buildings/port).

# Loot & More

The Forklift is indestructible and drops no loot. 

Some Forklifts spawn with a pallet with [Boxes](/obstacles/box), a [Barrel](/obstacles/barrel), or a [Grenade Crate](/obstacles/grenade_crate) on top of it.

# Tips

- Being indestructible, the Forklift is a pretty decent source of cover.
- Move around it to frustrate your opponents.
