The **Large Refinery Barrel** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.10.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.10.0) "Back with a Bang" update on September 14th, 2023.

# Location & Spawning

Two Large Refinery Barrels spawn in the [Refinery](/buildings/refinery) next to each other in an enclosed space also containing two [Regular Crates](/obstacles/regular_crate), two [AEGIS Crates](/obstacles/aegis_crate), one [Barrel](/obstacles/barrel), and one [Super Barrel](/obstacles/super_barrel).

# Loot & More

Large Refinery Barrels drop no loot and explode when broken. They take a very large amount of hits to destroy and reflect bullets.

# Tips

- Large Refinery Barrel makes a good cover from enemies due to their large size, extremely high health, and positioning.
  - If your opponent decides to go around the Large Refinery Barrel to reach you, simply move in the same direction of rotation around the Large Refinery Barrel to avoid your opponent if you don't want to fight.
  - If your opponent begins to damage the Large Refinery Barrel, get out of the enclosed space as soon as possible, as the Barrels will deal enough damage to one shot even a player with full Level 3 armor standing in the enclosed space.
- If you see a player looting near a Large Refinery Barrel that is showing smoke particles, use a gun with high obstacle DPS like an LMG to blow up the entire area, killing the player.
  - Make sure to stand far away, as the explosion from the Large Refinery Barrel has a large radius and deals extremely high damage.
  - If the player escapes the area before the barrels explode, attempt to finish them off using your guns.
