The **Bollard** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added to the game in the v0.11.0 "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023. It is indestructible and is a niche source of cover.

# Location and Spawning
The Bollard only spawns in between the edge of the [Port](/buildings/port) and the [Cargo Ship](/buildings/ship). 8 of them spawn in a line.

# Loot & More
The Bollard is indestructible, and therefore drops no loot.

# Tips
- Since the Bollard is indestructible, it can be use to hide from players with guns if need be.
    - However, since the Cargo Ship is so close and having to stand in the water slows you down, the Bollard should only be used as cover in certain situations.
