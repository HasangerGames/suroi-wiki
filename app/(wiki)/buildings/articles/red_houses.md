The **Red House** is a building added in the [v0.11.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.11.0) "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023 that comes in two variants. It is a small and compact structure with decent loot density, perfect for getting geared up early game. The Red House replaced the bigger [House](/buildings/house) that was added in v0.9.0.

# Location & Spawning

The Red House is a very common building around the map and can spawn anywhere on land. Three of each variant spawn on the Normal Map while two of each variant spawn on the Harvest and Halloween Maps.

# Areas

### Bathroom

The Bathroom contains a single [Toilet](/obstacles/toilet).

Toilets have a 50% chance to be used and a 50% chance to spawn as a regular Toilet.

### Bedroom

The bedroom contains a [Bed](/obstacles/bed), a [Bookshelf](/obstacles/bookshelf), and a [Small Drawer](/obstacles/small_drawer).

### Foyer

The Foyer contains a [Couch](/obstacles/couch), a [Large Drawer](/obstacles/large_drawer), and a bookshelf.

### Kitchen & Dining Area

The Kitchen contains a [Stove](/obstacles/stove) and a [Fridge](/obstacles/fridge). 

The Dining Area has a [Table](/obstacles/table) with two [Chairs](/obstacles/chair) and a Small Drawer by the door. 
  - Players can hide under the Table.

# Second Variant

### Bathroom

The Bathroom contains a single Toilet.

Toilets have a 50% chance to be used and a 50% chance to spawn as a regular Toilet.

### Bedroom

The Bedroom contains a [Small Bed](/obstacles/small_bed) and a Large Drawer with a [TV](/obstacles/tv) on top.

### Dining Area

The Dining Area has a [Table](/obstacles/table) with two [Chairs](/obstacles/chair) and a Bookshelf.

### Kitchen

The Kitchen contains a [Small Stove](/obstacles/small_stove) and a [Fridge](/obstacles/fridge). There is also a [Sink](/obstacles/sink) and a Small Drawer across from the Small Stove and Fridge. Additionally, there is a single [Potted Plant](/obstacles/potted_plant) outside of the kitchen.

# Tips

- If the Toilet is used, it likely contains guns or other weapons. If the Toilet isn't used, it likely contains healing items such as [Gauze](/healing/gauze) or [Cola](/healing/cola).
- Many players don't realize that the Fridge drops [2-3 Colas](/loot#fridge) when broken. Even late into game, you can often check Red Houses and still find some unbroken ones.
- While the Colas from the Fridge are valuable, try to find a weapon to defend yourself with first in case another player enters the Red House.
- If you have a gun with good obstacle DPS like an assault rifle or DMR, you can blow up the Stove from outside through the window.
  - This will kill or severely damage opponents.
- Use doors to block damage and frustrate your enemies.
  - The door in the Bedroom is particularly effective at this, and useful if you have no weapons.
