# Tips

- If you're low on health and have nowhere else to go, you can try hiding behind this to heal and avoid bullets.
- You can hide behind this with a gun that has little range or a melee weapon to force an opponent to approach where you can get a hit on them.
- Remember that Rocks are breakable and aren't fool-proof barriers.
- If there is a river rock that an enemy is hiding behind, you can destroy it to avoid getting close to them or to stop them from healing.
- Players trying to hide behind rocks are often low on health and can make for easy kills.
