The **Steyr AUG (Armee-Universal-Gewehr)**, known in-game as the **AUG**, is a bullpup assault rifle utilizing the 5.56mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.9.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.9.0) "Behind Close Doors" update on July 30th, 2023.

# Background

The AUG was designed by Steyr Arms in 1977 entering service in the same year. Since then, it has been a popular choice for militaries worldwide, first exporting to the US in 1980 and other countries later. It and its variants are still in service in many modern armies.

# Strategies

## Using

- The AUG has a somewhat high spread when moving, so try not to run and gun too much.
  - However, don't stand in one spot either, as this makes you an easy target unless there is no chance of retaliation.
- It has a higher DPS than the [AK-47](weapons/guns/ak47) making it an effective counter, especially in close quarters where spread matters less
- If you have a more accurate weapon such as a DMR or sniper, you can use the AUG in close range or to finish your opponent off.

## Countering

- While you can rush with a high DPS close-range weapon such as a [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi) to counter an AUG user, be mindful that the AUG can also be effective in close range.
- Outranging your opponent is a viable tactic due to the high moving spread of the AUG.
  - Snipers and DMRs can counter the AUG effectively.
  - Be sure to pick up a larger scope (e.g., 4x or 8x) for this strategy to work.

# Obtaining

The AUG is a very common gun, being more common than the [AK-47](weapons/guns/ak47). It can be found in many Crates, such as the [Regular Crate](/obstacles/regular_crate) and [Flint](/obstacles/flint_crate)/[AEGIS Crates](/obstacles/aegis_crate), as well as ground loot.

# Trivia
- The AUG was the first green colored gun added to the game.
