**Flechettes** is a [Perk](/perks) added in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. It splits your bullets into 3 smaller and weaker (but collectively stronger) bullets.

# Effects
All bullets are split into 3 smaller ones. Each smaller bullet has the following stats:
- 40% of original bullet's damage (120% if all 3 bullets hit)
- Deviation of 0.7 from the original trajectory.

# Obtaining
In Harvest Mode, Flechettes drops from the [Plumpkin](/obstacles/plumpkin), located in the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta). Like other perks, it is occasionally dropped from [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops) and more commonly from [Gold Airdrops](/obstacles/gold_airdrop_crate).

# Strategies
## Using
- Flechettes works great with high accuracy weapons such as snipers and DMRs, effectively giving them a damage boost with little penalty from missed shots.
  - It is mediocre with shotguns, as although it boosts their damage and makes it more consistent, it also increases spread significantly.
- This perk is more powerful in Squads, as the extra damage is helpful at taking down groups of players.
- Avoid using weapons with very low accuracy, as Flechettes can make them worse to use.

## Countering
- Don't be too afraid of opponents with the Flechettes perk, as the 20% damage boost is relatively modest.
- Back up from the opponent and use a long range weapon like snipers and DMRs, using the higher spread to your advantage.
