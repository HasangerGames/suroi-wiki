<Mode />
**Sabot Rounds** is a [Perk](/perks) added in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. It boosts bullet range, bullet velocity, and accuracy, at a slight cost of damage.

# Effects
- 50% Increased range
- 50% Increased bullet velocity
- 40% Increased accuracy
- 10% Decreased damage


# Obtaining
In Harvest Mode, Sabot Rounds drops from the [Plumpkin](/obstacles/plumpkin), located in the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta). Like other perks, it is occasionally dropped from [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops) and more commonly from [Gold Airdrops](/obstacles/gold_airdrop_crate).

# Strategies
## Using
- Some players may be turned away by Sabot Rounds' perk description of "lower damage". However, a 10% loss to damage is generally worth the other improvements.
- Most guns are buffed by Sabot Rounds, but in different ways.
  - Shotguns can shoot much farther with Sabot Rounds, allowing you to use them at some terrifying ranges.
  - Weapons that already had high bullet velocity, accuracy, and range, such as DMRs and snipers, becoming even better with Sabot Rounds. The extreme bullet velocity makes it much easier to land your hits on opponents.
  - The [USAS-12](/weapons/guns/usas12) and [M590M](/weapons/guns/m590m) are more dangerous, as they can shoot way farther.
  - Weapons that normally have slower bullet velocity, such as the [Model 89](/weapons/guns/model_89) and [RSh-12](/weapons/guns/rsh12), are much improved with Sabot rounds.
- Try and stay out in the open as well as at a distance, as this is where you have your biggest advantage.
- Find an 8x scope to spot your opponents from far away.

## Countering
- Hide behind [Obstacles](/obstacles), as the decreased damage of Sabot Rounds makes it harder to destroy cover.
- Because Sabot Rounds is most effective out in the open, forcing your opponent to fight inside [Buildings](/buildings) and bunkers makes their perk less effective.
 Use a Perk that increases speed, such as [Berserker](/perks/stark_melee_gauntlet) or [Second Wind](/perks/second_wind), as this will make you harder to hit in close range as well as giving you the freedom to quickly get close to them and use [Melee](/weapons/melee) or a shotgun.
