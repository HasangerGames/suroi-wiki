**Torn Pockets** is a [Perk](/perks) added in the [v0.21.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.21.0) "Plumpkin Panic" update on October 31st, 2024. It's a negative perk that causes you to drop two of any ammo every 2 seconds.

# Effects

Every 2 seconds
- Drop 2 of any ammo in your inventory.

# Obtaining
In Halloween Mode, Torn Pockets drop from [Diseased Plumpkins](/obstacles/diseased_plumpkin), which are scattered throughout the map as well as one in the [Plumpkin Bunker](/building/plumpkin_bunker). 

# Strategies
## Countering
- Since this is a negative-effect perk, it is ideal to switch it out as soon as possible - break some [Diseased Plumpkins](/obstacles/diseased_plumpkin), but be aware that there is a chance you get another negative-effect perk. 
- Pick up other ammos, even for guns you don't have, as the perk may drop that  ammo instead of what your gun needs.  
- If you have a gun such as the [VKS Vykhlop](/weapons/guns/vks) and are stuck with this perk, this perk can become very annoying, as 50 Cal ammo is relatively rare. This applies to other rare-ammo guns as well. 
- Finding the [Costumed Perk](/perks/costumed) can be a lifesaver, as it will switch out for Torn Pockets.
