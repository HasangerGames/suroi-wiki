The **CZ 75 Automatic**, known in-game as the **CZ-75A**, is an automatic pistol utilizing 9mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.9.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.9.0) "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023. It shoots very fast, but has a high spread and low damage.

# Background

The CZ 75 was designed by František Koucký starting in 1969. It uses a recoil system similar to the Browning Hi-Power pistol, but unlike most pistols, the slide rides inside its frame rails rather than outside. The CZ 75 Automatic variant was introduced in 1992 and has found use in military and law enforcement settings. It features a longer barrel with a compensator and a spot to attach an extra magazine (which can also be used as a foregrip). The CZ 75 is used worldwide, primarily by police.

# Strategies

## Using

- The CZ-75A is viable early-game in close-range against players with low-health armor. It loses its effectiveness against Level 2 and Level 3 [Armor](/equipment/armor) and is underpowered compared to other spray weapons, such as the [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi).
- Make sure to pick up as much 9mm ammunition as you can, as the CZ-75A uses a lot of it.
- The CZ-75A is most effective in CQC (Close Quarters Combat), such as [Buildings](/buildings).
- Most weapons are better than the CZ-75A, so replace it as soon as you can.
- Dual CZ-75As can work well early-game if you can't find a [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi) or a shotgun.
  - They can work well later in a round, but they aren't as effective against stronger armor due to the high spread and low damage and range.
- The best way to use Dual CZ-75As is to surprise your opponent when they don't expect an attack.

## Countering

- Weapons such as shotguns or other SMGs overpower the CZ-75A at close range.
  - The [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi) has much more DPS and damage than the CZ-75A
- Stay at medium or long range, because the CZ-75A is not very accurate. Assault rifles and DMRs work well for this.
- If an opponent with Dual CZ-75As charges you, hide behind cover. The cover will absorb much of the damage, and the long reload time exposes your opponent.

# Obtaining

- The CZ-75A is one of the most common weapons in the game. It can be readily found as ground loot or in Crates (most commonly the [Regular Crate](/obstacles/regular_crate)).

# Trivia

- Before 0.9.0, the [G19](/weapons/guns/g19) was fully automatic. After the CZ-75A was added, it was switched to semi-automatic.
  - The CZ-75A is much more powerful than the old G19.
- The CZ-75A is the first gun added from ČZUB (Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod).
- It was the second pistol to be added to the game, after the G19.
