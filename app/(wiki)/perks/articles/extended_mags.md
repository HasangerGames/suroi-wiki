**Extended Mags** is a [Perk](/perks) added in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. It increases the magazine capacity of most [Guns](/weapons/guns).

# Effects
- Increases the magazine capacity of the majority of [Guns](/weapons/guns).
  - Different guns have a different increased capacity, so it is not a universal stat increase.

# Obtaining
In Harvest Mode, Extended Mags drops from the [Plumpkin](/obstacles/plumpkin), located in the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta). Like other perks, it is occasionally dropped from [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops) and more commonly from [Gold Airdrops](/obstacles/gold_airdrop_crate).

# Strategies
## Using
- To make the most out of Extended Mags, choose Guns that are impacted the most.
  - It's best to check out each gun's extended capacity to get the most information on which guns are best.
  - Some good options, however, are shotguns like the [Vepr-12](/weapons/guns/vepr12) and [USAS-12](/weapons/guns/usas12), and DMRs like the [Mini-14](/weapons/guns/mini14).
- When you first pick up the [Perk](/perks), you will need to reload all your weapons to use Extended Mags.
- You can use your extra magazine capacity with DMRs to destroy cover and still have bullets left to kill them.
- Extended Mags is good in Duos and Squads, because you have extra capacity to deal with more players.
- You can bait players into attacking you when they think you're out of bullets, and then attacking them with extra bullets that you still have.

## Countering
- Hide behind indestructible or very high health [Obstacles](/obstacles) and bait your opponent to waste ammunition trying to attack you.
- Use a different Perk that boosts your damage rather than increases your magazine capacity. Keep in mind that while they do have a larger magazine, all the other stats for their gun, including the damage, are the same.
