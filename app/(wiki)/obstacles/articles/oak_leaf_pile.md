The **Oak Leaf Pile** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) that spawns commonly across the map on the Harvest and Halloween Maps. It was added alongside the Harvest Map in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. 
# Location & Spawning

200 Oak Leaf Piles spawn scattered around the Harvest and Halloween Maps.

# Loot & More

Oak Leaf Piles have no hitbox, allowing bullets, players, and grenades to pass through. 

# Tips

- You can use the Oak Leaf Pile as an emergency spot to heal if there aren't any other spots nearby. Still, the Oak Leaf Pile has extremely low health and can be broken with just a few bullets. Furthermore, many players will break Oak Leaf Piles with their guns to check for camping players so this isn't a foolproof strategy.
