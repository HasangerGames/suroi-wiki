**Engorged** is a [Perk](/perks) added in the [v0.21.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.21.0) "Plumpkin Panic" update on October 31st, 2024. It increases the player's health and size for every kill they have.

# Effects
- Max health increases per kill
- Player Size increases upon kill

# Obtaining
Engorged can be obtained from [Plumpkin Gamble](/perks/lets_go_gambling) which drops from [Diseased Plumpkins](/obstacles/diseased_plumpkin).

# Strategies
- Optimal Strategies fighting Engorged users change depending on the amount of kills they have.
  - When fighting an Engorged user with high kills, the optimal strategy is to forsake accuracy and attempt to land as many shots as possible, taking advantage of their large size while maximizing damage dealt to counter the extra health granted by the perk.
  - When fighting an Engorged user with low kills, treat them as if they are a normal player, albeit one with extra health and a slightly larger hitbox.
  - When fighting an Engorged user with no kills, treat them like a regular player.

## Using
- Utilizing this perk in conjunction with the [Low Profile](/perks/low_profile) can reduce the size-increasing effects of the perk as well as provide explosion resistance 
- Getting a limited amount of kills with Engorged can provide a not-so-large player size with the benefit of more health.

## Countering
- The more kills an Engorged perk user has, the more their size and health increases, making them both stronger and also bigger targets for high DPS weapons such as [Flues](/guns/flues)
- Don't let players with Engorged get away and try to chase them down, even if they have a single kill, they have larger hitboxes, so spamming DMR's is an effective strategy
