The **Christmas Tree** is a special variant of the [Pine Tree](/obstacles/trees) that spawns on the Winter Map. It appears to glow and drop loot when broken. There is only one Christmas Tree per map and it generates as part of the [Christmas Camp](/buildings/christmas_camp).

# Location & Spawning

One Christmas Tree spawns in the center of the Christmas Camp which only generates on the Winter Map.

# Loot & More

The Christmas Tree drops decent [loot](/loot#christmas_tree_normal) but takes many hits to destroy. It is recommended to use the [Ice Pick](/weapons/melee/ice_pick) which can always be found inside of the shed at the Christmas Camp that contains the [Ice Pick Case](/obstacles/ice_pick_case). You can also use a [Lewis Gun](/weapons/guns/lewis_gun) to break the Christmas Tree because it is a relatively common drop from [Blue Gifts](/obstacles/gifts) and has very high obstacle DPS. 

# Tips

- The Christmas Tree has a good chance of dropping a [Radio](/weapons/guns/radio) which can be used to summon an [Airdrop](/obstacles/airdrops) at your location.
- The Christmas Tree is very large and can be used as a cover from enemies. Moreover, it has a lot of health buying you more time.
- You can hide under the tree and wait for enemies to come to you. This is a good strategy if you have a lot of health and a good CQC weapon such as a [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues) or [Model 37](/weapons/guns/model_37).
- Be prepared for enemies camping the Christmas Tree.
- If an enemy is hiding behind the Christmas Tree, it is not a good idea to try and destroy it with most weapons especially if it is at full health. You'll just be wasting your ammo. Instead, try to chase them out of their cover.
  - If you do decide to try and destroy the Christmas Tree, make sure to have a weapon with a lot of ammo and a good obstacle multiplier such as the [Lewis Gun](/weapons/guns/lewis_gun) or [Stoner 63](/weapons/guns/stoner_63).
- The Christmas Tree still uses the old pre-v0.21.5 pine tree sprite as part of its texture.
