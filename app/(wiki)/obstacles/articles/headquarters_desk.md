The **Headquarters Desk** is an obstacle added in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) “High-Caliber Negotiations” update on September 22, 2024. It has a left and right variant.

# Location & Spawning  

Several Headquarters Desks spawn on the lower floor of the [AEGIS Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters) and in the Control Room of the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta).

# Loot & More  

The Headquarters Desk drops the same loot as the [Small Drawer](/obstacles/drawers). 

# Tips  

- Many players don't know that Headquarters Desks can drop loot. You can often still find intact Headquarters Desks inside of an already looted AEGIS Headquarters or Plumpkin Bunker.
  - This can be a good source of extra ammo or healing items if you find yourself running low on them.
- Even though the Headquarters Desk has a large hitbox, its low health and positioning inside of the buildings it appears in often limits using it as cover.

# Trivia  

- Despite the Headquarters Desk having "headquarters" in its name, they also spawn in the Plumpkin Bunker.
