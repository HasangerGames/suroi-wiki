The **Автомат штурмовой 12.7мм (Automatic Assault Carbine 12.7mm)**, known in-game as the **ShAK-12**, is an assault rifle utilizing the .50 Cal ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.27.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.27.0) "High and Dry" update on May 10th, 2025. It has a low magazine capacity, but extremely high damage from its duplex rounds.

# Background

The ShAK-12 was developed by the Russian small arms design company TsKIB SOO (sometimes referred to as CKIB SOO) in the late 2000s. It uses the same round from the VKS sniper (also designed by TsKIB SOO). It was intended for use in high-risk law enforcement operations, as it features a large amount of stopping power but not much penetration (ideal for urban environments to reduce the risk of collateral). The ShAK-12 features a bullpup design that reduces recoil and supports multiple different attachments, including flashlights, sights, and even an underbarrel 40mm grenade launcher. The battle rifle has seen limited adoption by Russian special forces, mainly the FSB.

# Strategies
## Using
- The ShAK-12 spawns with only 30 rounds, so conserving ammunition is extremely important.
  - Wait to engage until you're up close, to maximize your chance of hitting the enemy.
- Mind the very short range of the ShAK-12, so get as close as possible to your opponent.
  - You can try to bait your opponent into heading into enclosed spaces, and surprise them with the ShAK-12
- Break [Ammo Crates](/obstacles/ammo_crate) using a [Maul](/weapons/melee/maul) or other piercing [Melee Weapon](/weapons/melee) to get extra ammo.
  - Rushing [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrop_crate) is another good option, as they frequently have other .50 Cal weapons you can take the ammo for.
- Always have a secondary weapon in case you run out of ammunition, since it is a likely possibility.
  - You can choose a powerful CQC weapon such as a shotgun or SMG and completely overwhelm opponents close up.
  - Taking a longer-range weapon like a DMR or assault rifles like the [MCX Spear](/weapons/guns/mcx_spear) will give you a more balanced setup, so you can finish off opponents that try to run, or bait people from far away to get close.

## Countering
- Keep your distance from an opponent with the ShAK-12, as its short range is the biggest disadvantage.
  - Use a more accurate weapon such as a DMR or assault rifle to take out your opponent.
- Be wary of confined spaces such as [Buildings](/buildings) and Containers, as they are where the ShAK-12 is strongest.
- If you find yourself up close against a ShAK-12 user, you may be able to use a combination of shotguns like the [Model 37](/weapons/guns/model_37), quickswitching, and good movement to outplay them.
  - Certain weapons, such as the [Vepr-12](/weapons/guns/vepr12) or [Dual RSh-12](/weapons/guns/rsh12), have a higher DPS than the ShAK-12 — but you should still be careful.
- Strafe your opponent when they open fire with the ShAK-12, and use cover to your advantage to try and get your opponent to waste as many rounds of ammunition as possible; you may even be able to get them to run out.

# Obtaining
The ShAK-12 can be found in high-tier loot sources, specifically the [Briefcases](/obstacles/briefcase) and regular [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrop_crate).

# Trivia
- The ShAK-12 fires the 12.7x55mm Двухпульный, or "Duplex Bullet", which is two 17 gram bullets loaded inline.
- The ShAK-12 is the only assault rifle in Suroi that fires .50 Cal ammunition.
