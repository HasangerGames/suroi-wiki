The **Small Bridge** is a small building added in the [v0.16.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.16.0) “A Sailor’s Dream” update on February 25, 2024. 

# Location & Spawning
Many Small Bridges can spawn scattered around the map crossing rivers. Usually, you see Small Bridges connecting pieces of land though there have been instances where bridges overlap or lead to the ocean. 

# Loot & More
All Small Bridges contain some sort of loot at their center. It’s ideal to cross these bridges as sometimes they may harbor very good loot. Note that if loot is in the river, it will stop at the small bridge, pooling up at its side.

# Tips

- Try to cross these bridges when possible, as they may give you some loot.
  - However, do not linger on the bridge for too long because bullets are **not** blocked by the Small Bridge and the limiting width and lack of cover on the Small Bridge can make it a death trap.

# Trivia
- There have been several updates that broke Small Bridges, making them lead to the ocean, overlap, or not fully crossing a river.
  - While most bugs regarding Small Bridge spawning mechanics have been fixed, Small Bridges can still spawn in unintended locations on occasion.
