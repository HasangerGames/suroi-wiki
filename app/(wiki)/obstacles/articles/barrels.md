**Barrels** are a type of explosive [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.1.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.1.0) "We're back, baby" update on May 20th, 2023. They come in two variants.

# Location & Spawning

Normal Barrels are gray and can be found spawned randomly around the map. Additionally, they can also be found in [Buildings](/buildings) such as the [Warehouse](/buildings/warehouse) and the [Port](/buildings/port). 80 spawn per map outside of structures.

Super Barrels are red and can also be found spawned randomly around the map, but less frequently than normal Barrels. Only 30 spawn per map outside of structures.

# Loot & More

Barrels and Super Barrel drop no loot upon being broken, but they create an explosion that damages players and other [Obstacles](/obstacles). Explosions from Super Barrels deal more damage compared to Normal Barrels.

# Tips

- If a Barrel has low health and an enemy is nearby, try shooting the barrel to make it explode and eliminate the enemy.
- If you're low on health and have nowhere else to go, try hiding behind a barrel, but don't get too close, or it might explode on you!
- If there's smoke coming out of the barrel, that means the barrel is low on health, and you should avoid getting too close.

# Trivia

- The Barrels were designed by 123OP, Asultra, and Hasanger
- The Barrels are one of the first obstacles added to Suroi
