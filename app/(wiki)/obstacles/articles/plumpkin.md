The **Plumpkin** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) that only spawns on the Harvest and Halloween Maps and was added alongside the Harvest Map in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024.

# Location & Spawning

A single Plumpkin spawns inside of the third chamber inside the laboratory of the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta). Additionally, on the Halloween Map, five Plumpkins spawn in random positions around the map.

# Loot & More

A Plumpkin always drops three perks from [this list](/loot#fall_perks_normal).

# Tips

- The Plumpkin is one of the main attractions at the Plumpkin Bunker because the perks it can drop are very powerful. 
  - If you are the first player or team to arrive at the bunker, it is ideal to immediately head for the Plumpkin after getting some basic gear.
  - Often a perk will be left behind if the current team mode isn't squads. If you aren't first to arrive at the bunker you should still check the laboratory as there is a high chance there is still a perk left for you to grab. However, be prepared to fight as many players will want perks.

# Trivia

- The Plumpkin is never supposed to drop two or three of the same perk. However, this can still occur due to a bug.
