The **Table** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the v0.9.0 "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023.

# Location & Spawning

A single Table spawns in between two [Chairs](/obstacles/chair) in the Foyer of the [House](/buildings/house) and the Kitchen & Dining area of the [Small House](/buildings/small_house). One Table also spawns in the office in the [Refinery](/buildings/refinery) and inside the [Sheds](/buildings/port_shed) in the [Port](/buildings/port) and [Armory](/buildings/armory).

# Loot & More

Tables drop no loot when broken. Tables have no hitbox, so players and bullets can go through them.

# Tips

- Since the Table has no hitbox, it cannot be used as cover.
- You can hide under Tables to avoid players or to set up an ambush on another player approaching the building.
  - This is best done with a close-range weapon with high DPS such as the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues) or [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi).
