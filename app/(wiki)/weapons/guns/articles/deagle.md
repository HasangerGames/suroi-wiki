The **Desert Eagle**, known in-game as the **DEagle**, is a semi-automatic pistol utilizing the .50 Cal ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) "High Caliber Negotiations" update on September 22nd, 2024. The DEagle features high damage and a decent fire rate, but limited ammunition.

# Background

# Strategies
## Using
- The DEagle has a very distinct bullet trail and sprite, which makes it easy to identify one at a distance. Try and keep it stowed away until confrontations to surprise your enemy. 
- Be conservative with your ammunition usage, as you will have trouble finding more .50 Cal ammunition.

## Countering
- Strafe back and forth to make the DEagle user miss. This will waste their ammo, and you can attack while they reload.
- Hide behind indestructible cover such as [Oil Tanks](/obstacles/oil_tank) or [Sandbags](/obstacles/sandbags). The .50 Cal ammo that the DEagle uses is somewhat rare, so you may be able to make your opponent run out of it by wasting it.

# Obtaining
- The DEagle can only be found in [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrop_crate), or in the [Golden AEGIS Case](/obstacles/aegis_golden_case) located in the [Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters_meta)

# Trivia
- The DEagle is the only gun in the game that is gold
- The DEagle is one of 7 guns that were in surviv.io, the others being the [M1 Garand](/weapons/guns/m1_garand), [VSS](/weapons/guns/vss), [USAS-12](/weapons/guns/usas12), [AK-47](/weapons/guns/ak47), [Vector](/weapons/guns/vector), and [Mosin-Nagant](/weapons/guns/mosin).
