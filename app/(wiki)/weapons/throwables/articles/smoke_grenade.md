The **Smoke Grenade** is a [Throwable](/throwables) added in the [v0.15.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.15.0) "Pulling the Pin" update on Jan 14th, 2024. Upon detonation, it releases clouds of smoke that lasts for around twenty seconds.

# Background
A Smoke Grenade, designed as a canister-type device, serves various military purposes such as signaling, marking targets or landing zones, and screening unit movements. Unlike smoke bombs, which are simpler and ignited by an external fuse, smoke grenades are more intricate and emit a larger volume of smoke. They typically cost around $40 each, contrasting with smoke bombs that are considerably cheaper. The military's use of smoke grenades to obscure movement has influenced phrases like "to smoke" (to deceive) and "pop smoke" (to swiftly depart).

# Strategies
## Using
- The Smoke Grenade can be used as a way to quickly get a temporary place to hide.
  - This means that you can use it as a way to easily dodge bullets or to heal, as the enemy does not know where you are.
  - You can also use it on offense as a way to hide yourself while attacking, making it harder for your enemy to find your exact location.
  - However, while inside the smoke, your scope is reduced to 1x, which can  make it hard to see enemies. 
- Like the [Frag Grenade](/weapons/throwables/frag_grenade), Smoke Grenades cook the same way except the fuse time is only 2 seconds.

## Countering
- If the enemy is using the Smoke Grenade offensively, you can also hide in the smoke when it is safe to do so.
  - Avoid this if the enemy has powerful close-range weapons like shotguns and the [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi).

# Obtaining
Smoke Grenades can sometimes be obtained from [Regular Crates](/obstacles/regular_crate), but are much more often dropped from [Grenade Crates](/obstacles/grenade_crate).
