The **Confetti Grenade** is an explosive [Throwable](/throwables) added in the v0.18.0 "Back in the Saddle" update on June 8th, 2024. It has lower damage when compared to the [Frag Grenade](/throwables/frag_grenade) but has more shrapnel and can be carried in larger quantities.

# Strategies
## Using
- Confetti Grenades can be used in a similar manner to Frag Grenades, but keep in mind their lower radius and damage. 
  - See the [Frag Grenade](/throwables/frag_grenade) article for more information.

## Countering
- Move away from the grenade to avoid as much damage as possible.
  - This is usually not a challenge but can be if you are in an enclosed space or your opponent times their grenade well.
- If your opponent utilizes "grenade spamming", you can try to rush forward and out-DPS them at close range using a weapon such as the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues).

# Obtaining
Confetti Grenades are only obtainable from the [Confetti Grenade Box](/obstacles/confetti_grenade_box) and always drop in stacks of four. The Confetti Grenade is only obtainable during the 1st Anniversary and Fourth of July/20k discord members events.
