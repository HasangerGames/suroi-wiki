**Fists** are a melee weapon added in the original beta release of suroi on May 21st, 2023.

# Background

# Strategies

## Using

- Fists are usually used to break obstacles such as crates to get loot.
- Fists are also the only weapon you spawn with.
  - Fists are great for early game fights when both players do not own guns.
  - This requires skill as it can be tricky to land hits on your opponent without them hitting you.
- Fists, or any other melee weapon can be used to damage your opponent in extreme close range situations during any phase of the game.
  - Doing this usually surprises your opponent, allowing you to deal a decent amount of damage with good aim before they can react.
  - This is often effective if your opponent is already at low health.
  - Be careful if your opponent has a better melee weapon that they can switch to after you attack.

## Countering

- If you are being chased by a player trying to use fists and you don't want to engage in melee combat, try and keep your distance to gun them down.
- Often most guns are short enough so that they can still deal damage in short range.
  - Use this to your advantage and deal some extra damage to increase your chances of winning the fight.
  - This may be tricky if your opponent is strafing to avoid shots.
    - Shotguns can combat this with their large spread and number of pellets.
    - Weapons such as the [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi) can also work.

# Obtaining

All players spawn with fists so they are available for use at the start.
