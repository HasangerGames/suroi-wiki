The **Smoke Grenade** is a [Throwable](/throwables) added in the v0.15.0 "Pulling the Pin" update on Jan 14th, 2024. Upon detonation, it releases clouds of smoke

# Strategies

## Using

- The smoke grenade can be used as a way to quickly get a temporary place to hide
  - This means that you can use it as a way to easily dodge bullets to heal, as the enemy does not know where you are
  - You can also use it in offense as a way to hide yourself while attacking, giving the enemy an inability to counter you

## Countering

- If the enemy is using the smoke grenade offensively, you can also hide in the smoke when it is safe to do so
  - Avoid this if the enemy has powerful close range weapons like shotguns and the [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi)
