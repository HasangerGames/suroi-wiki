The **River Chest** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.16.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.16.0) "A Sailor's Dream" update on February 25th, 2024.

# Location & Spawning

Only one River Chest spawns per game in one of the rivers generated on the map. It cannot be seen on the minimap, similar to the [Viking Chest](/obstacles/viking_chest).

# Loot & More

The River Chest drops high quality weapons. See the River Chest Guns & River Chest loot tables in the [loot](/loot) page.

# Tips

- The River Chest has poor health so it is not recommended for cover from gun fire.
  - It's better to break this chest because it has good loot.
