The **L115A1 Long Range Rifle**, or **L115A1**, is a bolt-action sniper-rifle utilizing the .338 Lapua Magnum ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) "High Caliber Negotiations" update on September 22nd, 2024. It has very high damage, but a slow fire rate and high recoil.

# Background
The L115A1 is the British Armed Forces version of the Accuracy International-designed .338 Lapua Magnum AWM. It is outfitted with Schmidt & Bender 3-12×50 mm PM II/MILITARY MK II 3-12×50mm 0.1 mil telescopic sights. The L115A1 and its variants have seen use with the British Armed Forces in Afghanistan and Iraq.

# Strategies

## Using

- The L115A1 only spawns with 12 rounds of .338 Lapua Magnum, so conserve your ammo and don't waste your shots.
- Try and get your opponent to slow themselves down in some way because it makes hitting your shots easier.
  - You can do this when your opponent is in water, shooting, or using a [Healing Item](/healing) (or any combination).
  - The best target is a player who is standing still (you may want to conserve your ammo, though).
- The L115A1 works both close-range and long-range due to its high damage output.
  - Pair it with another high-damaging weapon, such as another sniper or a shotgun, to shred players.
- Always quickswitch the L115A1, as it has a lot of recoils as well as a long recoil time.
- Be careful, as the unique bullet trail of .338 Lapua Magnum ammunition will give away what gun you have and might lead players to target you.
  - This can be useful for getting high kills if you are skilled enough.
- If you find a L115A1 but have little to no ammunition, it probably isn't worth picking up, since your chance of coming across more ammo is next to nothing.
  - You could, however, try and use it to bait other players into an ambush.
- Despite having a 1x obstacle multiplier, the L115A1 is still somewhat capable of destroying cover.
  - This isn't a good idea, though, because of the very rare ammo.
  - If the opponent is near a [Barrel](/obstacles/barrel) or [Super Barrel](/obstacles/super_barrel) that is low on health and smoking, you can shoot it to do extra damage (though probably not as much as actually hitting them with the L115A1).
- Use LMGs such as the [Stoner 63](/weapons/guns/stoner_63) to destroy cover at long range, and then pick off players with L115A1.
  - You can also use assault rifles to weaken your opponent and then finish them off with the L115A1.
- By hiding in a [Bush](/obstacles/bush) and camping, you can surprise your opponents and kill them before they can react.
- If you ever run low on .338 Lapua Magnum ammo, you can break [Ammo Crates](/obstacles/ammo_crate) using a [Maul](/weapons/melee/maul) or other piercing [Melee Weapon](/weapons/melee) to get extra ammo.

## Countering
- Use lots of adrenaline to move faster, strafe, and get the L115A1 user to miss their bullets. This also wastes their ammunition.
- You can use cover to pretend to move out and get your opponent to shoot, but then move back and have the shot miss you.
- Although the L115A1 does a lot of damage, it usually isn't an instant kill, especially in the late game when you likely have high-tier [Armor](/equipment/armor).
- Watch out if you are at 8x or 15x range because the L115A1 has a very fast bullet velocity.
- The L115A1 can be unwieldy in CQC (Close Quarters Combat) due to its long barrel. Try using a high DPS weapon like a SMG or a shotgun. Weapons with short barrels, like the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues) work best for this.
- Other powerful snipers, like the [Tango 51](/weapons/guns/tango_51), while not as good as the L115A1, can still pack quite a punch against an opponent (especially in dual form).
- Powerful shotgun combos like dual [Model 37s](/weapons/guns/model_37) can sometimes overpower the L115A1 at close-range.

# Obtaining
- The only way to get the L115A1 is to either find one in a [Gold Airdrop](/obstacles/gold_airdrop_crate) or by breaking a [Flint Stone](/obstacles/flint_stone).

# Trivia
- At 150 damage, the L115A1 has the highest damage per bullet of any obtainable weapon. 
- The L115A1 has the fastest bullet speed of any gun (excluding the [Death Ray](/weapons/guns/death_ray)).
- A L115A3 (improved version of the L115A1) holds the record for the longest recorded sniper kill, killing two Taliban machine-gunners at a distance of 2,475 meters (8120 feet).
