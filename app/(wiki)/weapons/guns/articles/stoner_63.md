The **Stoner 63A Commando**, known in-game as the **Stoner 63**, is a 5.56mm LMG. It was added in the [v0.10.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.10.0) "Back with a Bang" update on September 14th, 2023. It is an LMG with a large magazine capacity, decent DPS, and high accuracy.

# Background

The Stoner 63 was developed by Eugene Stoner after he left ArmaLite in 1961. Stoner also designed the AR-15/M-16 assault rifles and the AR-10 battle rifles. It was designed around the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge and was a fully modular system. It could be configured as an assault rifle, carbine, top-fed light machine gun, belt-fed squad automatic weapon, or mounted to vehicles. The Stoner 63A was an improvement from the original design. The Stoner 63 saw limited use among U.S. special forces before being replaced by the M249 SAW. 

# Strategies

## Using

- The Stoner 63 has very good accuracy so make sure to have a 4x or 8x scope to take advantage of this.
  - The high moving accuracy can overpower other automatic weapons at long range.
- The Stoner 63 chews through ammo if you're not careful. Make sure to pick up ammo and avoid wasting shots.
- Due to its high obstacle multiplier and good DPS, the Stoner 63 is a great weapon for destroying obstacles. Use it to clear out enemy cover.
  - The Stoner 63 has the highest obstacle DPS in the game after the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues) and dual [DEagle](/weapons/guns/deagle).
- Make sure to take cover while reloading, as this gun has a long reload time.
  - It is useful to pair this weapon with a short-range weapon (e.g. a Flues or [Model 37](/weapons/guns/model_37)) to cover its weakness at close range.

## Countering

- If you see an enemy reloading, take advantage of their vulnerability by rushing them with a shotgun or other high-DPS weapon.
- Make sure to find indestructible cover such as a [Buildings](/buildings), Container, or [Oil Tank](/obstacles/oil_tank).
  - If you see or hear shots, try not to stay out in the open and find cover.
- The Stoner 63 has a long barrel. You can take advantage of this by rushing the opponent with a CQC (Close Quarters Combat) weapon such as an SMG or a Shotgun.
- Use lots of adrenaline and strafe the opponent to dodge bullets.
  - This is effective at wasting entire magazines and taking little damage if the opponent is fairly unskilled.
- Another high-DPS weapon such as [MCX Spear](/weapons/guns/mcx_spear) or a [Mini-14](/weapons/guns/mini14) can catch a Stoner 63 user off-guard if they are reloading or out in the open.

# Obtaining

The Stoner 63 is rarely found in [Flint](/obstacles/flint_crate) and [AEGIS Crates](/obstacles/aegis_crate) and uncommonly in [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrop_crate). It can also be found extremely rarely as world loot. The Stoner 63 also has a 1% chance to spawn in the [Refinery](/buildings/refinery) in place of the [MCX Spear](/weapons/guns/mcx_spear).

# Trivia

- The Stoner 63 is the second LMG added to the game, after the [Lewis Gun](/weapons/guns/lewis_gun).
  - It is also the second gun to show a visible magazine, after the Lewis Gun.
- Eugene Stoner also designed the [M16A4](/weapons/guns/m16a4) and the [SR-25](/weapons/guns/sr25).
