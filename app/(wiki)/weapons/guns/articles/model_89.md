The **Big Horn Armory Model 89 Carbine**, known in-game as the **Model 89**, is a lever-action DMR utilizing the .50 cal ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.16.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.16.0) "A Sailor's Dream" update on February 25th, 2024.

# Background
The Model 89 was developed by Big Horn Armory to supersede the older Model 86 and Model 92 lever actions in a modern platform. It features a wide variety of options and fires the powerful .500 S&W cartridge. As a CNC-machined rifle, all the parts are exceptionally precise, which gives to its prowess at the range.

# Strategies
## Using
- The Model 89 has a very distinctive barrel color, so keep it unequipped until you are ready to attack your opponent so that you surprise them.
- Make sure to conserve ammo when you can, as chances are you won't be able to find more.
- The Model 89 can play either like a sniper or a DMR. You can quickswitch it or spam it. Choose whichever style suits you better, but spamming isn't a good option when ammo reserves are low.
- Break [Ammo Crates](/obstacles/ammo_crate) if possible to try and get more .50 Cal ammunition.
- Always reload when not fighting, as the Model 89 has a high total reload time.

## Countering
- Strafe back and forth to make the Model 89 user miss. The slow rate of fire makes it harder to aim.
- Hide behind indestructible cover such as [Oil Tanks](/obstacles/oil_tank) or [Sandbags](/obstacles/sandbags). The .50 Cal ammo that the Model 89 uses is rare, so you may be able to make your opponent run out of it by wasting it.

# Obtaining
The Model 89 can be found in Airdrop, occasionally in [Gun Lockers](/obstacles/gun_locker), and very rarely in common loot sources such as [Regular Crates](/obstacles/crates). It is more common in Harvest mode.

# Trivia
- The Model 89 in-game is an 18" carbine with a standard walnut stock and a matte stainless steel finish.
- The Model 89 is one of the three weapons which use .50 Cal ammunition. The other weapons which use .50 Cal rounds are the [RSh-12](/weapons/guns/rsh12) and [DEagle](/weapons/guns/deagle).
