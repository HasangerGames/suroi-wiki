The **Port Shed** is a sub-building of the [Port](/buildings/port). It was added in the v0.11.0 "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023. It features indestrucible walls, a bookshelf, and a desk.

# Location & Spawning
One Port Shed spawns towards the center of every Port.

# Loot & More
The Port Shed has barely any loot (only a [Bookshelf](/obstacles/bookshelf) and a [Table](/obstacles/table)/[Chair](/obstacles/chair)) and is generally not worth checking out. It has a main building as well as a lowered [Barrier](/obstacles/barrier) to the Port.

# Tips
- While it doesn't have the best loot, the Port Shed's indestrucible nature makes a good refuge if you need to heal during a fight.
- You can hide under the desk to ambush other players.
    - This is generally not as nearly as effective as hiding under the desk in the [Refinery](/buildings/refinery), because few players bother to enter it.
