The **Regular Crate**, commonly known as simply the **Crate**, is an [Obstacle](/obstacle) added to the game in the v0.1.0 "We're back, baby" update on May 20th, 2023. Breaking them results in loot being dropped, ranging from very common to very rare items.

# Location & Spawning
On the normal map, 300 Regular Crates spawn randomly around the island. More can spawn as part of [Buildings](/buildings).

# Loot & More
The Regular Crate can drop a huge variety of decent [loot](/loot/#regular_crate), from guns to ammo to [Healing Items](/healing).

# Tips
- To break a Regular Crate, simply punch it with your fists or shoot it with a gun until it breaks and drops loot.
- Avoid using Regular Crates as cover, as they don't have much health.
    - However, it is worth noting that some cover is better than no cover and you can use them to waste your opponent's ammunition.
- There's no reason not to break Regular Crates, unless you're trying to get somewhere and can't stop to loot.
- If another player is using a Regular Crate as cover, don't hesitate to shoot at it if you have an assault rifle, DMR, or LMG, as it will shred through the Regular Crate.
