The **Diseased Plumpkin** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) that only spawns on the Harvest and Halloween Maps and was added alongside the Harvest Map in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024.

# Location & Spawning

A single Diseased Plumpkin spawns inside of the last chamber inside the laboratory of the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta). On the Harvest Map, this chamber is inaccessible without using exploits or bugs. However, on the Halloween Map, this chamber's barrier is completely broken, allowing full access to the Diseased Plumpkin. Additionally, 120 Diseased Plumpkins can spawn in random positions on the Halloween Map.

# Loot & More

A Diseased Plumpkin always drops the [Plumpkin Gamble](/perks/lets_go_gambling) which is a special perk that instantly swaps to a random halloween perk when picked up. See the Plumpkin Gamble article for more information.

# Tips

- Due to the abundance of Diseased Plumpkins on the Halloween Map, it shouldn't usually take very long for you to get a perk you want as you can usually find another Diseased Plumpkin in case you swap to a negative perk.
- The Diseased Plumpkin can also be used as cover due to its large hitbox.
- Normally, it is impossible to access the Diseased Plumpkin on the Harvest Map. Despite this, if you manage to get inside the last chamber, you can break the Diseased Plumpkin which will subsequently drop the Plumpkin Gamble perk and giving you access to one halloween perk. 
  - Keep in mind that since there is no way to get another Diseased Plumpkin, you are locked to the halloween perk that you swapped to, so generally this strategy is not recommended as there is no consistent way to glitch inside or outside of the last chamber and many of the halloween perks are negative.
