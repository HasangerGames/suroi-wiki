The **Nagant M1895 Revolver**, known in-game as the **M1895**, is a pistol utilizing 7.62mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the v0.11.0 "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023.

# Background
The M1895 was designed by the Belgian Léon Nagant for the Russian Empire. It is notable for its use of a special "gas-seal" system, which boosted the muzzle velocity, allowed it to be suppressed, and eliminated finger injuries. However, this came at the cost of reload time, both ejecting and reloading the cartridges. The M1895 was widely used in both Russian and Soviet forces up until it was officially replaced by the Makarov pistol in 1952. It continued to see use in Russia officially as late as 2009.

# Strategies
# Using
 - The M1895 is a great pestering tool. To take advantage of this, make sure to keep a distance between you and the enemy.
 - If the enemy has a level 2 vest or higher, it is advised that you give up, run away and not even try to pester the enemy, as this may slow you down.
 - The M1895 is an alright weapon, especially when it's rarity is taken into account, as it is the 2nd most common weapon in the game behind the G19.

# Countering
 - Make sure to close the distance between you and the M1895 user.
   - This is relatively easy to do due to the M1895's low damage.

# Obtaining
The M8195 is one of the most common weapons guns in the game and can be found in many places around the map.

# Trivia
- Initially, the M1895 would eject casings after each shot. Being a revolver, this is not possible in real life
  - This was fixed in v0.12.0, and now all 7 casings are ejected after reloading
- The M1895 is the third pistol in the game, and the first revolver
- Léon Nagant's brother, Émile Nagant, helped in the design of the [Mosin-Nagant](/weapons/guns/mosin)
- The M1895 is sur.oi's equivalent of surviv.io's OT-38.
