The **Beretta ARX160**, known in-game as the **ARX-160** or simply the **ARX** is an assault rifle utilizing 7.62mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.10.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.10.0) "Back with a Bang" update on September 14th, 2023.

# Background

The ARX160 was developed for the Italian Armed Forces in 2008 as a commercial weapon system independent from the Soldato Futuro ensemble. It is available in both 7.62x39mm and 5.56x45mm NATO and is a fully modular assault rifle. The ARX160 is used by a variety of police and special military forces around the world. 

# Strategies

## Using

- The ARX-160 is one of the best automatic weapons in mid-to-short range, with the high rate of fire and decent damage giving it a high DPS.
  - Be careful against opponents with longer-range weapons, because the ARX-160 is inaccurate at long range.
- The ARX-160 is a direct upgrade to the [AUG](/weapons/guns/aug), and has more DPS than the [AK-47](/weapons/guns/ak47).

## Countering

- The ARX-160's high spread makes it have a low effective range. Therefore, a more accurate assault rifle, DMR, or sniper can be used against an opponent with an ARX-160.
- If you are caught up close against someone using the ARX-160, try using an SMG like the [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi) or a shotgun.
- Hide behind indestructible obstacles such as Containers and [Oil Tanks](/obstacles/oil_tank).
- LMGs are also effective against the ARX-160, especially at longer ranges.

# Obtaining

The ARX-160 is relatively common in higher-tier crates, such as the [AEGIS crate](/obstacles/aegis_crate). It can also be found uncommonly as world loot.

# Trivia

- In real life, the ARX160 can be converted to 7.62x39mm using a conversion kit.
