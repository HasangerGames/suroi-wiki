The **Baseball Bat** is a melee weapon added in the [v0.5.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.5.0) "Locked & Loaded" update on June 24, 2023.

# Background

The Baseball Bat is a smooth wooden or metal club used in the sport of baseball to hit a baseball after it has been thrown. By regulation, a baseball bat may not be larger than 2.75 inches in diameter and no more than 42 inches in length. A baseball bat can also be used in other ways, such as bludgeoning people.

# Strategies

## Using

- Compared to fists and other melee weapons, the Baseball Bat has a slower swing speed, so missing a hit is more punishing.
- The large swing range can help in melee fights if your opponent keeps switching directions.

## Countering

- As with other melee weapons, the best way to avoid them is to keep the distance between you and your opponent.
- The [K-Bar](/weapons/melee/kbar) can out-DPS the Baseball Bat, so it is an effective counter to it.
  - [Fists](/weapons/melee/fists) also beat the baseball in terms of DPS and can be used as another counter. However, this requires much skill, as fists have a much smaller swing range.

# Obtaining

Baseball Bats have a high chance of spawning from the [Melee Crate](/obstacles/melee_crate). They can also be found rarely from [Regular Crates](/obstacles/regular_crate).

# Trivia

- The Baseball Bat was designed by Radians
- Baseball bats have been used for murder
- During the early days, players would use scrap wood to create their baseball bats
