The **Самозарядный карабин системы Симонова (Self-loading Carbine of the Simonov System)**, known in-game as the **SKS**, is a DMR utilizing the 7.62mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. It features a low magazine capacity low damage, but can reload single rounds like a shotgun.

# Background
The SKS was designed in the Soviet Union during the Second World War by Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov. Using a conventtional gas-operated design, the SKS is somewhat unique as a sem--auto in the fact that it can be reload by hand or with a stripper clip. The development of the AK-47 and its derivatives only a few years later rendered the SKS obsolete and it saw limited active service in the Soviet Union (although it was popular in Soviet satellite states). Today, the SKS is popular in the United States as a sports shooter but sees no active military use.

# Strategies
## Using
- Make sure to maximize the fire rate of the SKS to make the most out of the poor DPS.
- Similar to the [Mosin-Nagant](/weapons/guns/mosin_nagant), it is optimal to reload the full clip if most of it is already depleted.
  - Conversely, if it is mostly full, use the quick single reload to top off your magazine.
- In general, always try to have a full magazine because the damage per magazine is already extremely low for a DMR.
- Try to find a better weapon as soon as possible, because the SKS is largely ineffective against high tier [Armor](/equipment/armor).
- Carry a secondary weapon like a shotgun that has a higher damage output.

## Countering
- All other DMRs are superior to the SKS in DPS and can easily dispatch an opponent with a SKS.
- High-DPS weapons such as SMGs and shotguns can beat the Mini-14 at close range.
- Picking up Level 2 or 3 [Armor](/equipment/armor) will make you much harder for a SKS user to kill.
- Strafe back and forth (especially with high adrenaline) to make the opponent miss. 
- One of the best defenses against a SKS user is either indestructible cover ([Oil Tanks](/obstacles/oil_tank), Containers, and [Buildings](/buildings)) or cover in general ([Rocks](/obstacles/rock) and [Trees](/obstacles/tree)). The low damage output of the SKS makes it difficult to effectively destroy cover.

# Obtaining
The SKS is very common and can be found in many basic loot sources such as [Regular Crates](/obstacles/regular_crate).

# Trivia
- The SKS is the second gun in Suroi that has the ability to reload bullets one at a time when partially empty, but do a full reload when emptied, the other being the [Mosin-Nagant](/weapons/guns/mosin_nagant)

# History
