The **Steyr AUG**, known in-game as the **AUG**, is a bullpup assault rifle utilizing the 5.56mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the v0.9.0 "Behind Close Doors" update on July 30th, 2023.

# Background
The AUG was designed by Steyr Arms in 1977 entering service in the same year. Since then, it has been a popular choice for militaries worldwide, first exporting to the US in 1980 and other countries later. It and its variants are still in service in many modern armies.

# Strategies
## Using
- The AUG has a somewhat high spread when moving, so try not to run and gun too much.
  - However, don't stand in one spot either, as this makes you an easy target unless there is no chance of retaliation.
- It has a higher DPS than the [AK-47](weapons/guns/ak47) making it an effective counter, especially in close quarters where spread matters less
- If you have a more accurate weapon such as a DMR or sniper, you can use the AUG in close range or to finish your opponent off

## Countering
- While you can rush with a high DPS close-range weapon such as a [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi) to counter an AUG user, be mindful that the AUG can also be effective in close-range.
- Outranging your opponent is a viable tactic due to the high moving spread of the AUG.
  - Snipers and DMRs can counter the AUG effectively.
  - Be sure to pick up a larger scope (e.g., 4x or 8x) for this strategy to work.

# Obtaining
The AUG is a very common gun, being more common than the [AK-47](weapons/guns/ak47). It can be found in many Crates such as the [Regular Crate](/obstacles/regular_crate) and [Flint](/obstacles/flint_crate)/[AEGIS Crates](/obstacles/aegis_crate), as well as ground loot.
