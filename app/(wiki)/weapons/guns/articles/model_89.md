The **Big Horn Armory Model 89 Carbine**, known in-game as the **Model 89**, is a lever-action DMR utilizing the 12.7mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.16.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.16.0) "A Sailor's Dream" update on February 25th, 2024. Found only in [Gold Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops) and [Flint Stones](/obstacles/flint_stone), it has a slow fire rate but packs incredible damage.

# Background
The Model 89 was developed by Big Horn Armory to supersede the older Model 86 and Model 92 lever actions in a modern platform. It features a wide variety of options and fires the powerful .500 S&W cartridge. As a CNC-machined rifle, all the parts are exceptionally precise, which gives into its prowess at the range.

# Strategies
## Using
- The Model 89 has a very distinctive barrel color, so keep it unequipped until you are ready to attack your opponent so that you suprise them.
- Make sure to conserve ammo when you can, as chances are you won't be able to find more.
- The Model 89 can play either like a sniper or a DMR. You can quickswitch it or spam it. Choose whichever style suits you better, but spamming isn't a good option when ammo reserves are low.
- Break [Ammo Crates](/obstacles/ammo_crate) if possible to try and get more 12.7mm ammunition.
- Always reload when not fighting, as the Model 89 has a high total reload time.

## Countering
- Strafe back and forth to make the Model 89 user miss. The slow rate of fire makes it harder to aim.
- Hide behind indestructible cover such as [Oil Tanks](/obstacles/oil_tank) or [Sandbags](/obstacles/sandbags). The 12.7mm ammo that the Model 89 uses is very rare, so you may be able to make your opponent run out of it by wasting it.

# Obtaining
The Model 89 is only found in Gold Airdrops and [Flint Stones](/obstacles/flint_stone).

# Trivia
- The Model 89 in-game is a 18" carbine with a standard walnut stock and a matte stainless steel finish
- The Model 89 is one of the two weapons which use 12.7mm ammunition. The other weapon which uses 12.7mm rounds is the [M82 Barrett](/weapons/guns/barrett)
