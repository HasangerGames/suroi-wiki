The **Shed** is a building that generates as part of other buildings. It was added in the [v0.11.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.11.0) "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023.

# Location & Spawning

One Shed spawns towards the center of every Port near the [Barrier](/obstacles/barrier), in the lower right of the [Armory](/buildings/armory), on both sides of the [Large Bridge](/buildings/large_bridge), and in the [Christmas Camp](/buildings/christmas_camp).

# Loot & More

The Shed contains a [Bookshelf](/obstacles/bookshelf), a [Trash Can](/obstacles/trash_can), and a [Table](/obstacles/table) with a [Chair](/obstacles/chair). The Shed near the Christmas Camp also contains an [Ice Pick Case](/obstacles/ice_pick_case) underneath the Table.
# Tips

- While it doesn't have the best loot, the Shed's indestructible nature makes it a good refuge if you need to heal during a fight.
- You can hide under the desk to ambush other players.
  - This is generally not as effective as hiding under the desk in the [Refinery](/buildings/refinery), because few players bother to enter it.
