The **Fireplace is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added with the Harvest Map in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024.

# Location & Spawning

A single Fireplace spawns on the second floor of the [Lodge](/buidings/lodge) and blocks the way to the secret room that contains the [M590M Gun Mount](/obstacles/gun_mounts).

# Loot & More

The Fireplace doesn't drop loot and it explodes on impact, dealing minor damage to nearby obstacles and players.

# Trivia

- The Fireplace is supposed to deal much higher damage in-game but it doesn't as there is a bug currently in the game that makes explosions ignore layer checks when applying damage.
