**Shrouded** is a [Perk](/perks) added in the [v0.21.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.21.0) "Plumpkin Panic" update on October 31st, 2024 that surrounds the player equipped with it in smoke. 

# Effects

Players equipped with Shrouded constantly emit a thick trail of smoke around them. If you are the one with the perk, you will be able to see through the smoke.

# Obtaining
In Halloween Mode, you have a 1 in 12 chance to get the Shrouded perk after picking up a [Plumpkin Gamble](/perks/lets_go_gambling) perk dropped from a [Diseased Plumpkins](/obstacles/diseased_plumpkin). Diseased Pumpkins are scattered throughout the map as well as one in the [Plumpkin Bunker](/building/plumpkin_bunker). Shrouded does **not** drop from either [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops) or [Gold Airdrops](/obstacles/gold_airdrop_crate).

# Strategies
## Using
- This perk is built for CQC; if a player enters the smoke trail, they will not be able to see the player with the equipped perk. 
  - Try and get close to enemies and then shoot them with shotguns or other CQC weapons. They won't be able to see you, limiting what they can do.
  - The final circle can be one of the best places to use this perk for the reasons above. 
- However, if your opponent has a shotgun, there is still chance that they can kill you by blind firing, especially with the [Flues](weapons/guns/flues) or [Model 37](weapons/guns/model_37)
- 
## Countering
- If you do get in a fight with a player with this perk, use a shotgun or other CQC weapons to try and kill them.
    - Spray and pray is a good tactic in this case.
- Use [Advanced Athletics] (/perks/advanced_athletics) to combat players, as the 1.6x smoke speed boost can go well with shotguns.
