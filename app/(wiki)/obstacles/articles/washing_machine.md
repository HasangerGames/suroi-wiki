The **Washing Machine** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.9.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.9.0) "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023. It always drops one random skin.

# Location & Spawning

Washing Machines spawn in the Garages of [Houses](/buildings/house).

# Loot & More

The Washing Machine reflects bullets and drops either the "Verified or "no kill pls" skin as [loot](/loot#washing_machine).

# Tips

- The Washing Machine doesn't make an effective cover due to its positioning.
- If you want to loot the Washing Machine, do it last, since it has the least important loot in the House.
- This obstacle is currently unobtainable and can't be found on the map since the [House](/buildings/house) doesn't spawn on the map.
