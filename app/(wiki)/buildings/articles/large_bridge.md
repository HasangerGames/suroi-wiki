The **Large Bridge** is a large structure added in the [v0.18.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.18.0) “Back in the Saddle” update on June 8, 2024. 
# Location & Spawning
A few Large Bridges spawn every map crossing rivers (usually, many more [Small Bridges](/buildings/small_bridge) spawn). The low spawn rate of Large Bridges is balanced by the high quality of loot found there.
# Loot & More
Large Bridges have a lot of loot, most importantly an [AEGIS Crate](/obstacles/aegis_crate) and a few [Gun Cases](/obstacles/gun_case). Lower-value crates also make up part of the Large Bridge. It also has a massive [M1117](/obstacles/M1117) that makes great cover, as well as [Tear Gas Crates](/obstacles/tear_gas) that aid in killing and hurting players.
# Tips
- Grab some [Throwables](/weapons/throwables) from the [Grenade Crates](/obstacles/grenade_crate) near the edges of the bridge and use the grenade-hopping trick to blast grenades all over the bridge, instantly killing many players potentially armed with weapons. 
- Be careful when looting the high-value crates on the bridge, as [Barrels](/obstacles/barrel) linger there.
- Counter this by damaging (but not destroying) the barrel. When a player gets close to one, shoot it down. 
- Use the [M1117](/obstacles/M1117) and [Sandbags](/obstacles/sandbags) as indestructible cover. 
- Bullets cannot pass through the Large Bridge unlike the Small Bridge.
  - However, grenades can still pass on top of the Large Bridge's walls. This is especially deadly due to the limiting regions of the Large Bridge being extremely wide, making it very hard for opponents to escape a cooked [Frag Grenade](/weapons/throwables/frag_grenade).

# Trivia
- There have been many bugs with the Large Bridge where it spawned leading to nowhere or not fully crossing a river.
