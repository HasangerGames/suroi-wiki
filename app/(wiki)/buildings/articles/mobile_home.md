The **Mobile Home** is a building added in v0.15.0 "Pulling the Pin" update on January 14, 2024. It is a small & compact structure with four lootable obstacles.

# Location & Spawning

Nine Mobile Homes spawn across the map in random positions. All mobile homes contain a [Mobile Home Bed](/obstacles/mobile_home_bed), a small [Drawer](/obstacles/drawers), a [Mobile Home Sink](/obstacles/mobile_home_sink), and a [Mobile Home Stove](/obstacles/mobile_home_stove), as well as two [Boxes](/obstacles/box) and a normal [Barrel](/obstacles/barrels) on the exterior of the structure.

# Tips

 - If you see someone inside a Mobile Home, you can throw a few [Frag Grenades](/weapons/throwables/frag_grenade) which will explode the stove, causing the whole structure and the person inside to get exploded.
 - If you need a quick escape other than the two doors in the side and the back, you can break the [Window](/obstacles/mobile_home_window) to get a quick escape from an opponent.
