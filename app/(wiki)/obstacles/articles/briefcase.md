The **Briefcase** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.15.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.15.0) "Pulling the Pin" update on January 14th, 2024.

# Location & Spawning

A Briefcase always spawns in the Vaults of the [Armory](/buildings/armory) and the [Oil Tanker](/buildings/oil_tanker).

# Loot & More

The Briefcase can drop a [Vector](/weapons/guns/vector), an [ARX-160](/weapons/guns/arx160), a [Vepr-12](/weapons/guns/vepr12), or, extremely rarely, a [G19](/weapons/guns/g19).

# Tips

- The Briefcase almost always drops a decent weapon so it should be the first obstacle to head to in the buildings containing it.
- The Briefcase can't be used as cover due to its positioning.

# Trivia

- The Briefcase was designed by 1092384
