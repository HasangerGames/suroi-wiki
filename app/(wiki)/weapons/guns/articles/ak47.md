The **Автомат Калашникова образца 1947 года (Kalashnikov's Automatic Rifle Model 1947)**, known in-game as the **AK-47**, is an assault rifle utilizing 7.62mm ammunition. It was added in the [v0.2.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.2.0) "Fun guns" update on May 28th, 2023.

# Background

The AK-47 was developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov between 1945 and 1947. Accepted into service in 1949, its reliability and cost have made it and its variants a popular choice in militaries around the world. It was superseded by the AKM and later the 5.45mm AK-74.

# Strategies

## Using

- The AK-47 has superior accuracy to other comparable weapons, such as the [ARX-160](/weapons/guns/arx160), [AUG](/weapons/guns/aug), and [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi). Take advantage of this when using it against opponents with inaccurate weapons.
  - Consequently, it is advantageous to have a 4x or 8x scope when using the AK-47.
- At short-range, the AK-47 will also beat other fairly accurate weapons, such as the [MP40](/weapons/guns/mp40), because it has a higher DPS. Move closer to use this to a greater effect.
- The AK-47 has a standing spread of only 2 degrees. If you have an 8x or 15x scope, you can stand still to "snipe" players at long range.
  - Don't stand still for too long, or in the same spot. This makes it easier for an opponent to hit or figure out where you are.
- If you have a shotgun or a sniper, you can use the AK-47 to finish off an opponent after weakening them.
- The AK-47 is neither an excellent weapon nor a bad one. It is reliable, but may struggle against stronger [Armor](/equipment/armor) later in the game. Some other common guns such as the [AUG](/weapons/guns/aug) may fit your playstyle better, and rarer weapons are usually directly superior.

## Countering

- If you have a good high-DPS CQC (Close Quarters Combat) weapon such as a shotgun or SMG, a good tactic against an AK-47 user is to get as close as possible to try and negate any advantages they may have with accuracy.
  - Be careful, as your opponent may have a secondary CQC (Close Quarters Combat) weapon of their own.
  - The [AUG](/weapons/guns/aug) and [ARX-160](/weapons/guns/arx160) are good alternatives to SMGs against an AK-47, as they both offer higher DPS than the AK-47.
- The AK-47 may not be as effective at long range as some other assault rifles, DMRs, and snipers. Examples include the [MCX Spear](/weapons/guns/mcx_spear) and [Mini-14](/weapons/guns/mini14).
- All SMGs have a shorter reload than the AK-47, so use this to your advantage.

# Obtaining

The AK-47 is one of the more common guns in the game. It is less common than pistols and SMGs but can be found in a variety of places.

# Trivia

- Alongside the [M3K](/weapons/guns/m3k), the AK-47 is the first ever gun added to the game.
- The AK-47 is one of 7 guns that were in surviv.io, the others being the [Vector](/weapons/guns/vector), [M1 Garand](/weapons/guns/m1_garand), [VSS](/weapons/guns/vss), [USAS-12](/weapons/guns/usas12), [DEagle](/weapons/guns/deagle), and [Mosin-Nagant](/weapons/guns/mosin_nagant).
