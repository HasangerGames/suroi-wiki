The **Lily Pad** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.16.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.16.0) "A Sailor's Dream" update on February 26th, 2024.

# Location & Spawning

Lily Pads spawn commonly in rivers.

# Loot & More

Lily Pads do not drop anything when broken. Additionally, they have no hitbox, letting players, projectiles, and bullets pass through them.

# Tips

- Lily Pads can provide a useful hiding spot if you need to heal up.
  - Alternatively, you can also hide in a Lily Pad near a structure or [Airdrop](/obstacles/airdrops) and ambush players.
  - It can be tricky to position yourself correctly in the Lily Pad so that nothing sticks out of the Lily Pad.

# Trivia

- The Lily Pad was designed by Slapdap.
- The Lily Pad texture is bugged and has jagged edges when zoomed out.
