The **Filing Cabinets** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) "High-Caliber Negotiations" update on September 22nd, 2024.

# Location and Spawning

Several Filing Cabinets can be found spawning in various locations in the [AEGIS Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters) on both floors and inside of the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta). Notably, a Filing Cabinet blocks one of the ways inside of the secret room on the second floor of the Headquarters.

# Loot & More

Filing Cabinets drop common loot such as [Armor](/armor) and [Healing Items](/healing). See the [loot table](/loot#filing_cabinet_normal) for more information. Filing Cabinets can also reflect bullets which can be used to your advantage in some cases but can also be a hazard.
