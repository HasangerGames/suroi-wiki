The **Square Desk** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added alongside the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta) in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. 

# Location & Spawning

The Square Desk only appears in the Lobby of the Plumpkin Bunker, where it encloses a [Button](/obstacles/button) that can be used to open the blue sliding doors, letting players access the Security Office.

# Tips

- Try not to be caught inside of the Square Desk as you can easily be killed by someone with a CQC weapon such as the [Flues](/weapons/flues). Make sure you leave the area as soon as possible after activating the button.
  - In contrast, the whole of the Square Desk is a great piece of cover as it is completely indestructible.
