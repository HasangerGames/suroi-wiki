**Low Profile** is a [Perk](/perks) added in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. It shrinks the player and provides reduced damage from explosions.

# Effects
- 30% Damage reduction from explosions
- 20% Size reduction

# Obtaining
In Harvest Mode, Low Profile drops from the [Plumpkin](/obstacles/plumpkin), located in the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta). Like other perks, it is occasionally dropped from [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops) and more commonly from [Gold Airdrops](/obstacles/gold_airdrop_crate).

# Strategies
## Using
- Due to its explosive resistance, Low Profile is effective against not only [Frag Grenades](/weapons/throwables/frag_grenade), but the [M590M](/weapon/guns/m590m) and [USAS-12](/weapons/guns/usas12) as well.
- Low Profile makes you harder to hit, so you can use [Melee Weapon](/weapons/melee) with it and get up close.
  - Make sure to have high adrenaline and a solid Melee Weapon should you choose to do this.
- During Halloween Mode, Low Profile can be combined with [Lycanthropy](/perks/lycanthropy), making you even harder to hit.
  - Another good Halloween perk to combine Low Profile with is [Engorged](/perks/engorged). Not only does Low Profile help counteract some of Engorged's size increase, it also adds explosive resistance.

## Countering
- Explosive weapons are relatively ineffective against opponents with Low Profile
- Use shotguns like the [Model 37](/weapons/guns/model_37), as the spread of pellets means a greater chance of some of them hitting.
- Sniper rifles are very hard to use against an opponent with Low Profile, but DMRs can be managed.
  - You may need to spam the DMR to increase your chance of hitting them.
