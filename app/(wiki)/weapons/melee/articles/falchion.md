The **Falchion** is a melee weapon added in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) "High Caliber Negotiations" update on September 22nd, 2024. 

# Background
Falchions are a one-handed single-edged sword popular in Europe from the 13th through 16th centuries. A mystery surrounds the fact that very few examples have been found compared to the many thousands of straight-edged swords recovered. Designs varied widely around Europe, and researchers aren't sure the status of the people using them, as they aren't depicted being used by nobility, yet the craftsmanship is far above what a peasant would carry. Additionally, the use case is still unclear, whether they were for cutting through chain and leather armor or simply a utility tool used for clearing brush. 

# Strategies
## Using
- Use the large swing of the Falchion to hit enemies from farther away.
  - The large swing range can help in melee fights if your opponent keeps switching directions.
- Compared to fists and other melee weapons, the Falchion has a slower swing speed, so missing a hit is more punishing.
- The Falchion can be used to break [Ammo Crates](/obstacles/ammo_crate) and [Gun Lockers](/obstacles/gun_locker) that aren't breakable by [Fists](/weapons/melee/fists).

## Countering
- As with other melee weapons, the best way to avoid them is to keep the distance between you and your opponent.
- The [K-Bar](/weapons/melee/kbar) and [Baseball Bat](/weapons/melee/baseball_bat) actually out-DPS the Falchion, so it is an effective counter to it.

# Obtaining 
The Falchion can only be found in the [Falchion Case](/obstacles/falchion_case) in the [Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters_meta).

# Trivia
- "Falchion" is pronounced "Fahl-chion", not "Fal-shun" or "Fal-shi-un".
