The **Gold Rock** is a very rare variant of the [Rock](/obstacles/rock), and was added in the [v0.5.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.5.0) "Locked & Loaded" update on June 24th, 2023. It has 25% more health than a normal Rock and drops a [Mosin-Nagant](/weapons/guns/mosin).

# Location & Spawning

Only one Gold Rock spawns per map. - The Gold Rock is not visible on the minimap.

# Loot & More

The Gold Rock has a [100% chance](/loot#gold_rock) of dropping a Mosin-Nagant.

# Tips

- The Gold Rock is a very effective piece of cover if you end up being in a situation where you use it as such.
- If there are no other players around, immediately break the Gold Rock to get the Mosin-Nagant from it.
- Unless you have an LMG, it's likely not worth it to try and destroy the Gold Rock if a player is hiding behind it, due to the large amount of health it has.
