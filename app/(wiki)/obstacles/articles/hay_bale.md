The **Hay Bale** is an obstacle added in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. The Hay Bale is used as cover for most times. In the [Barn](/buildings/barn), the Hay Bale is placed to block players from getting [Flint Crate](/obstacles/crates).

# Background

Hay bales are tightly compressed packages of dried grass, legumes, or other vegetation that are primarily used as livestock fodder (a similar description that also includes straw is bale).

Historical cultures collected grass to feed animals in the non-growing seasons and usually stored it as loose hay in piles or barns. In Europe, farmers would cut plants with scythes, rake them into loose piles, and protect them with tarps or thatch.

In the 1800s, new agricultural tools led to better hay storage and transportation methods. The hay press, which was invented in the mid-1800s is where baling technology began; this hand-operated machine compressed hay into small bundles for easy storage.

Hay Bales are round-baled in games, the most common type of bale available today. Round bales have many advantages:
- Large round bales dry faster.
- A single person and a tractor can transport and store large bales, so less effort is needed.
- Round bales are more resistant to moisture.
- Round bales naturally ferment, which prevents molding and rotting.
- As a result of their shape, round bales are more well-suited to outdoor storage than square bales.
Round bales can weigh up to 2,200 pounds and be 1.2 to 1.8 meters wide. Round bales, however, are less dense and take up more space than square bales. Round bales are a practical and economical way to feed horses, cattle, and other livestock. They can be fed to groups of four or more horses, and only need to be put out once a week.

Hay has been used as a fuel source in poorer areas, they burn hay for cooking food and heating.

In many places, hay bales are used on hillsides or construction sites to keep dirt from eroding and retaining water flow. They are still a mainstay for animals like cattle, horses, sheep, and goats, particularly in the winter or in drought conditions.

Hay farming is a multi-billion dollar global business and one of the keystones of livestock-rearing economies. Hay bales are frequently thought of as rustic and pastoral, they often feature in artworks and photographs, as well as in farm-style home decor.

Today, hay production is struggling with a few challenges affecting hay supply and price:
- Unpredictable weather patterns have decreased hay production as farmers are forced to wait for sunny days and rain can diminish the quality of hay.
- U.S. hay supplies have been running low since the USDA began tracking forage supplies in 1973.
- Livestock and dairy farmers are changing their feeding programs which will likely temper demand for premium hay.
