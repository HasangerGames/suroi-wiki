The **Fire Hatchet** is a melee weapon added in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) "High Caliber Negotiations" update on September 22nd, 2024. 

# Background
A hatchet is a single-handed striking tool with a sharp blade on one side used to cut and split wood, and a hammerhead on the other side. Fire hatchets have a spike on the back and are used to break down windows and doors.

# Strategies
## Using
- The Fire Hatchet can be used to break [Ammo Crates](/obstacles/ammo_crate) and [Gun Lockers](/obstacles/gun_locker) that aren't breakable by [Fists](/weapons/melee/fists).
- With a high DPS, the Fire Hatchet fairs well against most other melee weapons.

## Countering
- As with other melee weapons, the best way to avoid them is to keep the distance between you and your opponent.
- The [Hatchet](/weapons/hatchet) has a higher DPS than the Fire Hatchet, and the [Maul](/weapons/maul) is on par.

# Obtaining
The Fire Hatchet can currently only be obtained in the [Fire Hatchet Case](/obstacles/fire_hatchet_case) on the [Oil Tanker](/buildings/oil_tanker).

# Trivia
- Currently the Fire Hatchet has worse DPS than the normal [Hatchet](/weapons/melee/hatchet).
