The **Pan** is a melee weapon added in the [v0.23.1](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.23.1) update on January 27, 2025.

# Background
- TBA 

## Using
- The pan is unique among all melee weapons, deflecting bullets that hit the pan sprite when it is unequipped/equipped. Therefore, the pan can be used to block enemy gunfire, as well as being usable as a regular melee weapon when equipped.

# Strategies
- The pan can be used to escape players firing upon you, by angling the unequipped pan towards other players, it is possible to deflect the bullets, saving your own health and allowing you to run away
- The pan can be equipped and held as a way to block bullets in narrow corridors, or held facing other players as a way to heal while they waste their bullets.  

## Countering
- As a pan is capable of blocking bullets, it is wise to keep some distance from them, or wait until you can get an opening and shoot them with a sniper
- Explosive weapons such as the [Usas-12](/weapons/guns/usas12) and the [M590M](/weapons/guns/m590m) can still damage pan users, as the pan does not block shrapnel.
- Grenades can be used to damage pan users, as they also are not affected by the pan's ability
  
# Obtaining

The Pan can be obtained from the [Pan Stove](/obstacles/pan_stove) and [Small Pan Stove](obstacles/small_pan_stove), with both being distinguishable from their regular counterparts by a pan sprite appearing in one of the bottom two stoves.
