The **Ruger Gunsite Scout**, known in-game as the **RG Scout**, is a bolt-action sniper rifle utilizing the 5.56mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.22.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.16.0) "Cold Steel" update on December 11th, 2024. It features a low firing delay and high magazine capacity and is a direct upgrade of the [CZ-600](/weapons/guns/cz600).

# Background

The Ruger Gunsite Scout is a bolt-action rifle showcased by Sturm, Ruger & Co at the SHOT Show in 2011. It was based on the Ruger M77 bolt-action rifle and designed in collaboration with the Gunsite Academy.

# Strategies

## Using

- As it is a direct upgrade, the RG Scout can be played in a similar fashion as the CZ-600.
  - It can be quickswitched effectively due to its large magazine size. This often pairs well with the [M3K](/weapons/guns/m3k) due to the similar magazine capacities between the two weapons. 
  - It can also be used as a DMR-like weapon due to it having the same high fire rate as the CZ-600. Vulnerability is less of a problem when utilizing this strategy because of the higher damage and magazine capacity of the RG Scout.
- The RG Scout can be more effective than most other snipers such as the [Tango 51](/weapons/guns/tango_51) during the end game due to its high magazine capacity, allowing you to not have to reload as often. This is extremely valuable during the end game in particular because reloading during the final stages is often deadly; it gives your opponent a window to deal as much damage as possible without your ability to retaliate.

## Countering
- Due to the low DPS of the RG Scout, you can attempt to bring your opponent into close ranges and kill them with a high-DPS weapon like the [Vepr-12](/weapons/guns/vepr12). 
  - If your opponent knows what you are trying to do and keeps their distance, you can alternatively engage with another weapon that is effective at ranged fights such as the [MCX Spear](/weapons/guns/mcx_spear) or the [Stoner 63](/weapons/guns/stoner_63).
- If you are confident in your quickswitching and aiming skills, you can also try using another sniper like the [Mosin-Nagant](/weapons/guns/mosin_nagant) that has higher damage than the RG Scout.
# Obtaining
On the Normal Map, the RG Scout can only be found in the [Lux Crate](/obstacles/lux_crate) located in the [Red Tugboat](/buildings/tugboat_red). However, on the Harvest and Halloween Maps, it can also be found relatively commonly in high-tier loot sources such as [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops) and [Gun Lockers](/obstacles/gun_lockers) as well as occasionally from common loot sources such as [Regular Crates](/obstacles/crates).

# Trivia
- Similar to the [BLR](/weapons/guns/blr) and [M1 Garand](/weapons/guns/m1_garand), the RG Scout has a special firing sound that plays when the last round in the magazine is fired.
