The **Warehouse** is a building added in the [v0.9.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.9.0) "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023. It features plenty of early-game loot, perfect for getting geared up.

# Location & Spawning

Up to five Warehouses attempt to spawn each game anywhere on the Normal Map. On the Harvest and Halloween maps, four Warehouse attempt to spawn instead.

# Loot & More

There are three different possible layouts of the Warehouse. They can contain varying amounts of [Boxes](/obstacles/box), [Grenade Boxes](/obstacles/grenade_box), [Regular Crates](/obstacles/crates), [Grenade Crates](/obstacles/crates), [Ammo Crates](/obstacles/ammo_crate), and both variants of the [Barrel](/obstacles/barrel).

# Tips

- You can stand close to the Warehouse and still be able to see with your scope.
  - This is very useful for seeing enemies on the other side of the Warehouse if you have an 8x or 15x scope.
- Be careful of standing in corners, as reflected bullets can easily kill you.
- The barrels in some of the warehouses can be a death trap.
  - Likewise, use the barrels to try to kill other players.

# Trivia

- In v0.21.3, the Warehouse was completely redesigned.
  - The pre-v0.21.3 Warehouse was designed by Leia and 1092384.
- Originally, the Warehouse was going to be a smaller, squarer building, but this was scrapped.
