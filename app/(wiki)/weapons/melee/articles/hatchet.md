<Stub/>
The **Hatchet** is a melee weapon added in the [v0.18.1](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.18.1) update on June 21, 2024.

# Background

A hatchet is a single-handed striking tool with a sharp blade on one side used to cut and split wood, and a hammerhead on the other side. Hatchets may also be used for hewing when making flattened surfaces on logs; when the hatchet head is optimized for this purpose it is called a hewing hatchet. More about it at [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatchet).

# Strategies

## Using

- The Hatchet is good at breaking obstacles and it can break [Flint Stone](https://wiki.suroi.io/obstacles/flint_stone).
- It is advised that you shouldn't use the Hatchet during fights due to its low DPS of 71.43 (for reference, [Fists](https://wiki.suroi.io/weapons/melee/fists) has a DPS of 80).

## Countering

- Watch out when a player with Hatchet tries to approach you at close range, use shotguns when needed.
- Switch to melee as soon as they are too close, most melees have more DPS than Hatchet so try to utilize them.
