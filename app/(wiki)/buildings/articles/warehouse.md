The **Warehouse** is a building added in the [v0.9.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.9.0) "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023. It features plenty of early-game loot, perfect for getting geared up.

# Location & Spawning

Up to 5 Warehouses attempt to spawn each game anywhere on the normal map.

# Loot & More

The Warehouse always spawns with 3 [Regular Crates](/obstacles/regular_crate), 6 [Boxes](/obstacles/box), and 1 [Barrel](/obstacles/barrel). The Regular Crates and Barrels are in the corners, and the Boxes are along either side on [Metal Shelves](/obstacles/metal_shelf).

- There's 30% chance a [Flint Crate](/obstacles/flint_crate) will replace the crate directly across from the [Barrel](/obstacles/barrel).
- The center of the Warehouse can drop decent [loot](/loot#warehouse).

# Tips

- You can stand close to the Warehouse and still be able to see with your scope.
  - This is very useful for seeing enemies on the other side of the Warehouse if you have an 8x or 15x scope.
- Be careful of standing in corners, as reflected bullets can easily kill you.
- The barrel in the one corner can be a death trap.
  - Likewise, use the barrel in the corner to try to kill other players.
- If the Warehouse has a Flint Crate, loot it first, as it has the most valuable loot.
