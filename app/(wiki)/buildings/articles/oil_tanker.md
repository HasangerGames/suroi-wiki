The **Oil Tanker** is a sub-building of the [Port](/buildings/port). It was added in the [v0.15.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.15.0) "Pulling the Pin" update on January 14, 2024. It features a big cargo area, which contains three [Large Oil Tanks](/obstacles/large_oil_tank) and a control room, in which you can find the [Vector](/weapons/guns/vector) upon opening the door using the control panel.

# Location & Spawning

The Oil Tanker can be found spawning offshore of the Port on the edge of the map in 50% of games.

# Areas

## Cargo area

The [Ship](/buildings/ship)'s main and biggest area, the cargo area, is found from one end of the ship and almost until the other end, ending in the control center. On the cargo area, you can find three Large Oil Tanks that you can use for cover in battles, a few [Sandbags](/obstacles/sandbags), some [Barrels](/obstacles/barrels), and an assortment of different types of [Crates](/obstacles/crates).

## Control room

The control room features a large [Drawer](/obsatcles/drawers), a wide window, and a set of control panels. The middle control panel can be interacted with to open the [Vault Door](/obstacles/doors) to the left, which contains a [Briefcase](/obstacles/briefcase) as well as two [Regular Crates](/obstacles/crate).

# Tips 

- When you enter the Oil Tanker, grab a weapon and quickly head to the control room to check if the weapon inside the Briefcase has been taken.
  - In case it has, watch out for enemies that might have it.
- Use the oil tanks as cover when fighting dangerous enemies, but beware of grenades!
