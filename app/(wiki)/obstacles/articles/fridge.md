The **Fridge** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.9.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.9.0) "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023. It drops [Colas](/healing/colas).

# Location & Spawning

Fridges spawn in many residential structures such as [Red Houses](/buildings/red_houses) and the [AEGIS Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters).

# Loot & More

The Fridge reflects bullets and always drops 2-3 [Colas](/healing/colas) upon being broken.

# Tips

- Some players don't know that you can break Fridges, so you can sometimes stumble upon houses that still have Fridges but are otherwise completely looted.
- Be careful if you're using a gun to destroy the Fridge, as you could damage yourself with the reflected bullets.
  - Some people also choose to first destroy the [Stove](/obstacles/stove) that spawns close to most Fridges, which usually heavily damages the Fridge.
