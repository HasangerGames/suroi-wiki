The piercing metal-headed hammer known as the **maul** is a melee weapon that was made obtainable again in the v0.15.0 "Pulling the Pin" update on 1/14/24.

# Background

The maul is a long-handled hammer with a heavy head of wood, lead, iron, or steel. It functions and appears just like a sledgehammer. Sometimes a spear-like spike is on the fore-end of the head. The creator of the maul is not known as many sites don't talk about it. It was mainly known to appear at the late 14th century. Now a days, the maul is mostly used to split wood.

# Strategies

## Using 

- Try getting close to your opponent without losing too much health, then use the one tap clicking method when you're close enough. Maul is also one of the melees with high damage.
  - It's not advisable to rush someone with the maul if they have a weapon as the cooldown is not super quick.
- Using the maul to kill your opponent requires skills at dodging and good reaction times in the case that your opponent changes the direction they move in.    

## Countering 

 - If you see player who has a maul and is rushing you, you can retaliate by keeping your distance while gunning them down.
  - If you don't feel confident in combating a maul, just run away, they should eventually stop chasing you.

# Obtaining 

The maul can only be obtained from the maul mount in the [Armory Center](/buildings/armory_meta) as of right now.
