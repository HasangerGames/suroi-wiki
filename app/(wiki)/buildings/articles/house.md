<Removed />
The **House** was a building added in the [v0.9.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.9.0) "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023. It was later removed from spawning on the map in the v0.11.0 "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023 and completely removed in the v0.17.0 "Just the Two of Us" update on April 1st, 2024. It had a decent amount of loot for early games.

# Areas

## Foyer

The Foyer contains no loot, but it does have a [Table](/obstacles/table) and two [Chairs](/obstacles/chair). - However, the ability to hide under tables was not added until [v0.11.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.11.0), so players were never able to hide under the tables in the House.

## Kitchen

The Kitchen, directly next to the entrance, contains a [Stove](/obstacles/stove) and a [Fridge](/obstacles/fridge). Many players don't realize that the fridge drops [2-3 Colas](/loot#fridge) when broken. Even in late game, you can often check Houses and still find some unbroken ones.

## Bedroom

The Bedroom, located in the corner directly opposite the entrance, contains a [Bed](/obstacles/bed), and a [Bookshelf](/obstacles/bookshelf).

## Living Room

The Living Room, across from the Bathroom, contains a [Couch](/obstacles/couch), [TV](/obstacles/tv), and [Large Drawer](/obstacles/large_drawer).

## Bathroom

The Bathroom contains a singular [Toilet](/obstacles/toilet).

## Garage

The Garage contains a Bookshelf, [Regular Crate](/obstacles/regular_crate), [Barrel](/obstacles/barrel) and a [Washing Machine](/obstacles/washing_machine). - The door to the Garage can be punched until broken. - The washing machine has a 1/3 chance to drop the "no kill pls" skin and a 2/3 chance to drop the "Verified" skin (see [loot table](/loot#washing_machine)).

# Tips

- Be careful of the long corridor, as it's easy to get caught and sprayed down.
- You can easily kill inexperienced opponents if they're low by backing up and shooting through the door with an assault rifle, which they won't expect.

# Trivia

- The Garage has an oil stain on the floor, possibly suggesting a car or other vehicle had been there before.
