# Writing Articles

First of all, thanks for helping out with the documentation! We need all the help we can get.<br/>
Since this wiki is a custom coded solution, creating articles is a bit different to what you might be used to over on Fandom.

If you find any grammar errors, or inconsistencies in general in the wiki, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi-wiki/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi-wiki/pulls) at the [github repository](https://github.com/HasangerGames).

Articles are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/), an extension of the typical Markdown you may be used to.

# Style Guide

When writing an article for an object in the game, please follow the layout below. If in doubt, consult an existing
article (e.g., [AK47](/weapons/guns/ak47)).

## Article Layout

### General Pointers

- Articles should be written in American English (e.g. color rather than colo**u**r).
- We read your article submissions to check if they are high quality and relevant.
  - We automatically spell check your submissions.

## Syntax

See the [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/) docs for a detailed overview of MDX. If you are new to Markdown, you can find a
guide [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Extensions

There are a couple [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/) / [JSX](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) tags you can use to make your articles more interactive. They are listed below for your reference.

### `<Event />`

Shows a small banner at the top of the page like the one on the [USAS-12 Article](/weapons/guns/usas12) notifying readers
that this item is only available in a specific event. See below:

<Event />

### `<CommitLink sha="Git SHA Hash" />`

Shows a link to a commit on the GitHub repo. Useful for linking to the commit that introduced a feature.

<CommitLink sha="1da8f75e" />

- **sha** The SHA1 hash of the commit. Can be shortened to 7 characters.

### `<TimeLink time={Unix Milliseconds} />`

Shows a link to a specific time. Adjusts to the user's timezone. Clicking on it copies the ISO 8601 timestamp to the clipboard, and hovering shows it.
See below:

<TimeLink time={1699868632020} />

- `time`: Unix milliseconds, UTC timezone

### `<RemovedItem />`

Shows a small banner at the top of the page notifying readers the item has been removed from the game. See below:

<Removed />

### `<DevWeapon/>`

Shows a small banner at the top of the page notifying readers the item is a developer weapon and unobtainable. See below:

<DevWeapon />

### `<SuroiItemImage itemID="item idString" width="optional" height="optional" rotation="optional" variation="optional" append="optional" dual="optional" />`

An item image from the game. Requires the item idString.

Options:

- `width`: width in px
- `height`: height in px
- `rotation`: rotation in degrees
- `variation`: for sprites with variations, a number
- `append`: for sprites that have suffixes like "\_world" at the end of their sprite file name
- `dual`: for dual guns only

<SuroiItemImage itemID="death_ray" />

### `<Gallery images={[array of GalleryImage]}/>`

A gallery of images.

<Gallery
  images={[
    {
      url: "/img/suroi.svg",
      author: "John Doe",
      caption: "Suroi Logo",
    },
    {
      url: "/img/logo.svg",
      author: "Jane Doe",
      caption: "Suroi Wiki Logo",
    },
    {
      type: "youtube",
      url: "67Rs86gc1Ds",
      author: "Jon Doe",
      caption: "Suroi Menu Music",
    },
  ]}
/>

This is a bit more complicated to use, as it involves [Javascript objects](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp).

We use an array of `GalleryImage`s, as seen in `src/lib/types.ts`:

```jsx
<Gallery images={[GalleryImages]} />
```

This is the code for the gallery example above:

```jsx
<Gallery
  images={[
    {
      url: "/img/suroi.svg",
      author: "John Doe",
      caption: "Suroi Logo",
    },
    {
      url: "/img/logo.svg",
      author: "Jane Doe",
      caption: "Suroi Wiki Logo",
    },
    {
      type: "youtube",
      url: "67Rs86gc1Ds",
      author: "Jon Doe",
      caption: "Suroi Menu Music",
    },
  ]}
/>
```
