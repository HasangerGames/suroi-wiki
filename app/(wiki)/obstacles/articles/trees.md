Trees are a type of obstacle that spawn frequently on the map. They were added to the game in the v0.1.0 "We're back, baby" update on May 20th, 2023, and come in 3 variants.

# Location & Spawning

Trees are extremely common obstacles and can spawn just about anywhere on the map. Birch and Pine Trees are rarer than Oak Trees, making them harder to find.

# Loot & More

Trees drop no loot upon being broken.

# Tips

- Trees make decent cover from enemies.
  - Pine Trees have a larger hitbox, making it harder for your opponent to shoot you from behind your cover.
  - Birch Trees have higher health, allowing you to buy more time or force your opponent to waste additional ammo.
  - However, all 3 variants can be easily destroyed with any high-DPS weapon in a matter of seconds.
- If your opponent is hiding behind Tree to avoid shots or heal up, just shoot the Tree down. They have low health and are easy to destroy.
- In the end game, campers may hide in the overlapping area of 2 Trees. Shoot a bullet or two into these areas to chase any remaining players out.
