The **Lux Crate** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in [v0.16.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.16.0) "A Sailor's Dream" update on February 25, 2024.

# Location & Spawning 

One Lux Crate spawns in the [Red Tugboat](/buildings/tugboats) in each game.

# Loot & More

The Lux Crate always drops a scope and on the normal map, a [CZ-600](/weapons/guns/cz600). On the Harvest and Halloween Maps, it drops either a [VKS Vykhlop](/weapons/guns/vks) or a [Tango 51](/weapons/guns/tango_51). Both have an equal chance to spawn.

# Tips

- Since the Lux Crate has extremely low health and poor positioning, it makes poor cover from enemies.
- It is almost always better to break it for loot since it drops the powerful [CZ-600](/weapons/guns/cz600) on the normal map and the extremely powerful [VKS Vykhlop](/weapons/guns/vks) or [Tango 51](/weapons/guns/tango_51) on the Harvest and Halloween Maps.
