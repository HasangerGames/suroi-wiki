**Tablets** is are a consumable that restores 50 adrenaline, added in the v0.6.0 "Tablets & Tweaks" update on July 2nd, 2023. They spawn rarely around the map. To use Tablets, either click on the icon in your inventory or press 8 on your keyboard. Tablets take 5 seconds to use.

# Background

Tablets, also known as pills, are a solid form of oral medicine. They usually include a variety of active substances and excipients in a powder form, which is then made into a tablet shape by either molding or compression.

# Strategies

## Using

- The speed boost for adrenaline is linear, so if you have a lot of Tablets and Cola, make sure to use them to get the maximum speed boost possible.
- The health regeneration, however, is not linear. Make sure to keep your adrenaline above 50 to take advantage of it.
- You might be able to "bait" your opponent into attacking by pretending to use a Tablet, even though you don't actually need it.
- Make sure you are in a safe and/or easily defensible location when using Tablets, as the long slowdown makes you vulnerable.
  - If someone starts attacking you, cancel the Tablets and start fighting the (default keybind is X).
- If you only have 1 Tablet, it may be worth saving it until you can find another Tablet or a Cola, as then you can get the full health boost.
- Tablets are better used to fill up the adrenaline bar, whereas Colas are ideal to "top off" your adrenaline.

## Countering

- If you see someone out in the open with adrenaline particles, you can quickly attack them. This might take them off guard and take off a large chunk of their health.
  - Just because someone is using adrenaline does not mean they have low health, as with Gauze and Medikits.

# Obtaining

Tablets are most readily obtained by breaking toilets in buildings, as well as the Porta-Potty. Tablets can also be rarely found in crates and even world loot.

# Trivia

- Presumably, the Tablets are some kind of painkiller
- The Tablets in the texture for the item are the same color as the suroi logo

    - Above 87.5 adrenaline now heals 2.75 health/second
    - Above 50 adrenaline now heals 2.125 health/second
    - Above 25 adrenaline now heals 1.125 health/second
    - Above 0 adrenaline now heals 0.625 health/second
