# Tips 

- When you enter the Christmas Camp, you should break the Gifts under the Christmas Tree first to get weapons.
- You should prioritize heading for Christmas Camp if you are near since Christmas Camp includes good loot.
  - Expect many players to appear at Christmas Camp, as they are there to get loot and, especially, Ice Pick.
