**Airdrops** are a game mechanic added in the v0.13.0 "Terminal Velocity" update. Two Airdrops spawn naturally each game, but more can be called on demand using the [Radio](/weapons/guns/radio). Airdrops contain a randomized selection of high value loot. Airdrops are dropped from a plane that flies over the map, and the location of where the airdrop will land is revealed to all players in the game using a ping alert after the airdrop is dropped from the plane.

# Location and Spawning

Two Airdrops naturally spawn each game at a random location within the safe circle. However, it is possible to call additional Airdrops using the rare [Radio](/weapons/guns/radio).

The normal Airdrop is the most common. The Gold Airdrop is significantly rarer, replacing a normal airdrop 5% of the time (see <FileLink file="common/src/definitions/obstacles.ts" lines={528}>obstacles.ts</FileLink>), but drops powerful weapons such as the [ACR](/weapons/guns/acr) and [Barrett M95](/weapons/guns/barrett), which are exclusive to the Gold Airdrop and the [Flint Stone](/obstacles/flint_stone).

# Loot & More

Airdrops contain rare and useful loot, including powerful weapons, large scopes, medical supplies and exclusive skins. The loot table can be found [here](/loot#airdrop_crate). Very rarely, a Gold Airdrop will spawn with a [G19.](/weapons/guns/g19)

# Tips

- Airdrops are a source of high value loot, but are also a source of danger. Be careful when approaching an Airdrop, as other players may be waiting in ambush.
  - Thus, if you see an Airdrop nearby, you can wait for other players to approach it and then attack them.
  - If you are pursing this strategy make sure to have a good CQC weapon such as the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues).
  - Conversely, make sure to check your surroundings when approaching an Airdrop, as well as bushes and other areas nearby where players may be hiding.
- Unopened Airdrops with their cover on ("Airdrop" in the sidebar) are indestructible and reflect bullets, providing a good source of temporary cover.
  - However, they can easily be opened by interacting with them so be cautious of relying on them for cover.
- Once you loot an Airdrop, you can hang around it and wait for other players to approach it, then attack them with your new loot.
  - However, if you are not confident in your ability to win a fight, it may be better to leave the area as soon as you have finished looting it.
