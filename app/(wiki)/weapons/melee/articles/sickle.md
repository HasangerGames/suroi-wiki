The **Sickle** is a melee weapon added in the [v0.18.2](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.18.2) "Pulling the Pin" update on July 4th, 2024.

# Background

The Sickle is a one-handed tool used for agricultural purposes. It features a curved blade which enables it to harvest crops effectively. A user should swing the sickle against the base of a crop, capturing the crops in a curved area (to maximize efficiency) and slicing them. Sickles are very old tools; there are surviving examples of the Sickle from the Epipalaeolithic Era, which was over 10000 years ago. Although not designed to be one, the Sickle has been used as a weapon in Southeast Asia. For example, The Celurit, a tool native to Indonesia and similar to the Sickle, is used not only as a farming tool but also as a defensive weapon.

# Strategies

- The Sickle possesses a greater attack range, so rushing another player is more advisable with this weapon

## Using

- The Sickle has a longer cooldown which makes it have a low DPS output.
 - Make sure to time your shots well when using the Sickle.
- The Sickle can be seen as a [Baseball Bat](/weapons/melee/baseball_bat) but with worse DPS.
- Overall, the Sickle isn't a great weapon and should be swapped out for most Melees.

## Countering

- As with all melee weapons, the best way to avoid them entirely is to keep your distance and use a gun designed for mid or long-range combat to kill them.
 - Use a high-DPS weapon like the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues) to shoot down the Sickle user approaching you if you can't escape.
- The Sickle isn't exactly a powerful melee so don't be afraid of fighting a Sickle user if you must as most other melee weapons are better than the Sickle.
- Overall, the Sickle is a decent melee weapon, having poor damage but better range than other melees.
- The Sickle should be swapped out for other melee weapons, such as the [Falchion](/weapons/melee/falchion), [Maul](/weapons/melee/maul), [Hatchet](/weapons/melee/hatchet), [K-Bar](/weapons/melee/kbar), [Seax](/weapons/melee/seax) and the [Baseball Bat](/weapons/melee/baseball_bat).
- The Sickle can also be thought of as a nerfed falchion, attacking the space in front of the player, but having less DPS, attack damage as well as not being a piercing weapon.

The Sickle is obtained from Melee Crates(/obstacles/melee_crate) and Airdrops(/obstacles/airdrops).
