Crates are a type of obstacle that spawn around the map randomly. They come in three distinct variants with different loot. Regular crates were first added to the game in the v0.1.0 "We're back, baby" update on May 20th, 2023. Later, update v0.5.0 "Locked & Loaded" brought the other crate variants.

# Location and Spawning

Crates are generally very common and spawn frequently out in the open. Crates and their variants can also be found inside some buildings. The Regular Crate is the most common, while the AEGIS and Flint crates are rarer. Only six AEGIS crates and six Flint crates spawn per map outside of structures. A single melee crate always spawns per map.

# Loot & More

All crates drop some sort of loot. The Regular Crate drops the lowest quality loot, while the AEGIS and Flint crates drop better loot. Melee crates always drop two melee weapons per crate.

# Tips

- Regular Crates are very common, so you can usually find one if you need loot.
- Try to go for the AEGIS and Flint crates first as they drop better loot.
  - However, AEGIS and Flint crates do not reveal their locations on the map.
- Crates can provide limited cover in a pinch, however they are easily destroyed with any type of weapon.

# Trivia
