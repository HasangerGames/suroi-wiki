The **Clearing Boulder** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) that spawns across the map on the Harvest and Halloween Maps. It was added alongside the Harvest Map in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. 
# Location & Spawning

15 Clearing Boulders outside of clearings are randomly scattered across the map on the Harvest and Halloween Maps. Additionally, 3-6 Clearing Boulders can additionally spawn inside of each clearing.

# Loot & More

Clearing Boulders have the highest health and largest hitbox out of all [Rock](/obstacles/rock) variants. They drop no loot upon being destroyed.

# Tips

- The Clearing Boulder is a very solid piece of cover if you can find one nearby. The high health and large hitbox can ensure you take minimal damage from any opponents shooting in your direction.
- [Frag Grenades](/weapons/throwables/frag_grenade) and [Smoke Grenades](/weapons/throwables/smoke_grenade) can still fly over the Clearing Boulder when they are traveling at high speeds.
  - Frag Grenades can be used to drive an opponent out of behind the Clearing Boulder. You can either throw the grenade without cooking it or begin to cook the grenade. Both are effective strategies of making your opponent move out from behind the boulder.
  - Smoke Grenades can cause confusion and allow you to sneak up to your opponent with a CQC weapon if you use the Smoke Grenade within short ranges.
- Certain weapons with extremely high obstacle DPS can still be used to destroy the Clearing Boulder such as the [SR-25](/weapons/guns/sr25).
- The [M590M](/weapons/guns/m590m) fires FRAG-12 rounds which can be used to damage an opponent who doesn't have a direct line of sight with you due to their explosive shells. This is also the case for the [USAS-12](/weapons/guns/usas12).
- Overall, the Clearing Boulder is an excellent source of cover but can be countered using grenades or certain weapons.
