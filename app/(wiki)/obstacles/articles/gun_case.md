The **Gun Case** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.15.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.15.0) "Pulling the Pin" update on January 14th, 2024.

# Location & Spawning

Five Gun Cases spawn in the [Armory](/buildings/armory) in various locations around the structure.

# Loot & More

Gun Cases drop 1-2 guns of medium quality. See the special guns tier in the [Loot Tables](/loot) for more information.

# Tips

- Since the Gun Case has extremely low health, it makes poor cover from enemies.
  - It is almost always better to break them for loot since they have a high chance of containing a decent weapon.
