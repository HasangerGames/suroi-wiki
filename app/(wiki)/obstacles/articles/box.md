The **Box** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.9.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.9.0) "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023. It drops a variety of loot for its compact size.

# Location & Spawning

Boxes spawn inside many structures such as [Warehouses](/buildings/warehouse) and the [Port](/buildings/port).

# Loot & More

The Box has similar [loot](/loot#box) to the [Regular Crate](/obstacles/regular_crate), but generally drops ammunition and [Healing Items](/healing) more often than guns.

# Tips

- Boxes are a compact and decent source of loot.
- If you're trying to find a gun, opt to break Regular Crates first, since they are more likely to drop guns.
