The **Revitalizer** is a dev-only shotgun firing 12-gauge ammunition. It was secretly added in the [v0.9.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.9.0) "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023. While initially decreasing both the player's maximum health and adrenaline, it will increase those two greatly beyond their normal amounts if the user kills players with it. Its effects—both positive and negative—stack in two ways; by getting multiple kills and by equipping multiple Revitalizers.

# Strategies

## Using

- Early on, pick your fights very carefully, as you only have half your normal health.
- Remember that each pellet that connects with an enemy will give back 2 health and 1.5 adrenaline. This greatly improves your longevity in fights, and should not be underestimated.
  - It also means that "chipping" your opponent (firing and only hitting a few pellets) is a viable strategy.
- Whatever you do, do <i>not</i> drop your Revitalizer if it has kills on it because they will be lost if you do.
- Your increased speed allows you to outmaneuver enemies, either defensively or offensively.
- Even if you shouldn't be overconfident, you should also know how to abuse your boosted stats. Having almost 4 times the health of everyone else means that many counters that would traditionally work (like LMGs and even some assault rifles) simply cease to work.

## Countering

- Pick on low-boost players. Typically, they will play more defensively and will be moving at regular speed. Here, you'll have 4 times their health, so almost any weapon can take them down, even weapons traditionally countered by shotguns.
- A boosted Revitalizer player is very, very hard to take down. The only thing capable of cleanly taking down a fully boosted (whether single or double) player is the [Large Refinery Barrel](/obstacles/large_refinery_barrel). Thus, your best option is usually to try and disengage; a 1v1 fight with a boosted Revitalizer is extremely in favor of the Revitalizer player, and depending on how boosted they are, even 2 or 3 players might not be enough.
  - That being said, the [Death Ray](/weapons/guns/deathray) wins against Revitalizer.
- Stats-wise, it's the same as the Model 37, except for the health/adrenaline-altering things; this means that staying out of its range is a viable strategy. Just be careful, as a boosted player may be able to close the distance

# Obtaining

As a dev-only weapon, the Revitalizer is only obtainable by Developers. However, it is available on the arena and debug maps.

# Trivia

- It is a [Model 37](/weapons/guns/model_37) with a pistol grip, telescoping stock, and a custom pump.
  - One can spot a device mounted similarly to sight above the gun, with a red wire connecting it to an object
    fixed to the muzzle. Presumably, this device is the cause of the gun's unique properties.
- The pellets fired from this weapon are always spread out in a uniformly distributed pattern, with a bias towards sending pellets parallel to the aim line.
- The effects of the Revitalizer stack if one equips multiple; here's a table showing the various combinations.
