The **Stump** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) that only spawns on the Harvest and Halloween Maps and was added alongside the Harvest Map in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. It is a relatively common obstacle on both the Harvest and Halloween Maps.

# Location & Spawning

40 Stumps spawn around the Harvest and Halloween Maps in random locations.

# Loot & More

Stumps do not drop loot. However, the [Hatchet Stump](/obstacles/hatchet_stump) does. 

# Tips

- Stumps have 180 health, so they can be used as cover against opponents with weaker weapons.

# Trivia

- The Stump was designed by EmeraldNeo.
