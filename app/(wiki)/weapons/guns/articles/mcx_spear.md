The **SIG Sauer MCX Spear**, known in-game as the **MCX Spear**, is an assault rifle using 7.62mm ammunition. It was [v0.5.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.5.0) "Locked & Loaded" update on June 24th, 2023. It has high DPS, low magazine capacity, and very good accuracy.

# Background

The MCX Spear is the civilian version of the XM7, which was selected by the US military in early 2019 as a potential replacement for the M4 carbine and M249 SAW. It is normally chambered in the new .277 SIG FURY cartridge, which performs better against body armor than the old 5.56x45mm NATO. The MCX Spear was offered on the civilian market starting in 2022. That same year, the United States Army awarded SIG Sauer a 10-year contract to produce the XM7 and XM250 to replace the M4 and M249. 

# Strategies

## Using

- The MCX Spear has a higher DPS than comparable guns such as the [AK-47](/weapons/guns/ak47), [ARX-160](/weapons/guns/arx160) and [AUG](/weapons/guns/aug).
  - Use this to your advantage when facing an opponent using one of these guns.
  - It is also more accurate, which means a larger scope (4x or higher) will help you outrange your opponents.
- Keep in mind that the magazine capacity of the MCX Spear is on the lower side, being 20 instead of the standard 30 for similar weapons. It is also hampered by a longer reload time.
  - Thus, it is important to reload often (behind cover, of course) and not miss your shots.
- While the MCX Spear can be used as a CQC (Close Quarters Combat) weapon due to its higher DPS, it is still advisable to carry a secondary, high-DPS weapon such as the [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi) or [Model 37](/weapons/guns/model_37) to deal with enemies at close range.

## Countering

- Rushing an MCX Spear user is more risky than other similar assault rifles due to its higher DPS.
  - If you do decide to rush, make sure to have a high DPS weapon such as the [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi) or [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues).
- If you have a higher scope and a sniper or DMR you could try to outrange them. Beware, though, as the MCX Spear is still a powerful weapon at range.
- Generally, the MCX Spear is a potent weapon, especially in the hands of a skilled player.
- Use cover, particularly indestructible cover (like an [Oil Tank](/obstacles/oil_tank) or Container) when possible, as being caught in the open against an MCX Spear user is a death sentence due to its high DPS.
- Exploit the MCX Spear's low magazine capacity and long reload time by attacking when they are reloading.

# Obtaining

The MCX Spear has a 99% chance to be found in the Office at the [Refinery](/buildings/refinery). It is also a relatively common drop from [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops). The MCX Spear is rarely found as world loot in locations such as [Regular Crates](/obstacles/regular_crate) and slightly less rarely from mid-tier loot sources such as [AEGIS](/obstacles/aegis_crate) and [Flint Crates](/obstacles/flint_crate).



# Trivia

- The MCX Spear in-game uses a barrel change to 7.62x51mm NATO.
  - In addition to the standard .277 SIG FURY, it is also available with a 6.5mm Creedmoor barrel.
