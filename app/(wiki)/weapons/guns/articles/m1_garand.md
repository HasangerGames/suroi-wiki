The **M1 Garand** is a DMR utilizing 7.62 ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.13.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.13.0) "Terminal Velocity" update on November 27th, 2023. Despite the low clip size, it has very high DPS, accuracy, and range.

# Background

The M1 Garand was designed by John Garand in the 1920s and 1930s, and production started in 1937. It greatly increased the output of an individual soldier over older bolt-action rifles. Millions were made and used by the US during World War Two, and it saw continued use through the Korean War and even into the Vietnam War. A large number of countries have either purchased M1 Garands or received them from aid packages. Thus, the M1 Garand has been used in over 30 major conflicts worldwide since its inception.

# Strategies

## Using

- Like most DMRs, the M1 Garand has very good accuracy and range, so make sure to get a good scope like an 8x or 15x to take advantage of this.
- Unlike most DMRs, however, the M1 Garand has a much smaller clip size of only 8 rounds. This makes missing a shot much more punishing, so prioritize aiming and hitting your shots over getting the max DPS.
- The M1 Garand works well when paired with an LMG, as the LMG can be used to destroy cover and then the M1 Garand can deal lots of damage quickly.
  - Shotguns also pair well, as they cover the close-range combat that the M1 Garand is not as good at.
- Be wary of ambushes by opponents with close-range, high-DPS weapons like shotguns and SMGs.
- Don't use the M1 Garand to destroy the cover, as you will waste most of your clip on it and not have enough left to do much damage to your opponent.

## Countering

- Like most DMRs, you can use a high-DPS weapon such as a shotgun or SMG at close range against an M1 Garand user.
  - Watch out, as they may have a secondary weapon of their own.
- At long range, you may be able to use a sniper rifle to out-damage the M1 Garand user if you use cover and "peek" from out behind it.
- Get as much adrenaline as you can, and use the increased speed to strafe your opponent and waste their bullets.
  - Never move in straight and predictable directions if you suspect someone with the M1 Garand is attacking you.
- Attack while the M1 Garand user is reloading, as this is when they are most vulnerable.
  - The "ping" sound after the last round makes it easy to tell if they are out of bullets and reloading.

# Obtaining

- The only way to get the M1 Garand is to either find one in a [Gold Airdrop](/obstacles/gold_airdrop_crate) or by breaking a [Flint Stone](/obstacles/flint_stone).

# Trivia

- The "ping" sound after the last round is the sound of the enbloc clip being ejected.
- The M1 Garand is one of 7 guns that were in surviv.io, the others being the [Vector](/weapons/guns/vector), [AK-47](/weapons/guns/ak47), [VSS](/weapons/guns/vss), [USAS-12](/weapons/guns/usas12), [DEagle](/weapons/guns/deagle), and [Mosin-Nagant](/weapons/guns/mosin).
