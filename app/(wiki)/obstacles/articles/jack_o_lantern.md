The **Jack O' Lantern** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) that was added to the game in the [v0.21.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.21.0) "Plumpkin Panic" update on November 1st, 2024.

# Location & Spawning

75 Jack O' Lanterns spawn around the Halloween Map in random locations. They can also be found in fixed positions near the entrances of several buildings such as the [Red House](/buildings/red_houses).

# Loot & More

Jack O' Lanterns have a 40% chance to drop a [Costumed](/perks/costumed) perk as well as the loot table for the [Large Pumpkin](/obstacles/large_pumpkin).

# Tips

- If you are stuck with a negative halloween perk, you can break a Jack O' Lantern as it has a good chance to drop a Costumed perk which overrides your current halloween perk.
- Jack O' Lanterns are even more effective than Large Pumpkins at being a piece of cover as they have a high amount of health.
