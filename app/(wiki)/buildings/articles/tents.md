**Tents** are small buildings that were added alongside the Harvest Map in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. They come in two sizes and contain mediocre loot.

# Location & Spawning

Up to eight Big Tents, twelve Normal Tents, and one Special Tent spawn randomly across the map on the Harvest and Halloween Maps. 

Big Tents and Normal Tents are either colored red, green, blue, or orange. Big Tents spawn two of each color per map while Normal Tents spawn three of each color per map.

Special Tents are the same size as Normal Tents and are always purple in color.

# Loot & More

Big Tents can spawn with up to five [Boxes](/obstacles/box) in the interior or right outside one of the exits. Some of these Boxes can be randomly replaced with [Office Chairs](/obstacles/office_chair) or [Grenade Boxes](/obstacles/grenade_box). They also contain two instances of world loot in the interior.

Normal Tents always contain a single Box and an instance of world loot on the floor while Special Tents contain a [Gun Case](/obstacles/gun_case). Special Tents are also more likely to spawn high tier guns on the floor.

Destroying a wall or a pole of the tent will cause the entire structure including any remaining walls or poles to collapse.

# Tips

- Tents do not contain exceptional loot, so don't waste time trying to reach a Tent that is not nearby as the loot that it contains isn't usually worth the walk over.
- Be careful against opponents with strong weapons like the [SR-25](/weapons/guns/sr25) when using Tents as cover. The entire Tent can easily be destroyed in less than a second by those weapons since destroying any part of the Tent's structure causes the whole thing to collapse.
- Tents are a good place to hide and heal quickly if necessary.
