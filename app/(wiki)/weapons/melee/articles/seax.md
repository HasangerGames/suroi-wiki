The **Seax** is a melee weapon added in the v0.15.0 "Pulling the Pin" update on January 14, 2024.

# Background

The Seax is a large single-edged blade with a tang in the centerline of the blade, inserted into an organic hilt either made of wood or horn. Its typical use is for hunting and fighting.

# Strategies

- The Seax has a longer cooldown but has higher damage.
 - Make sure to time your shots well, as missing one can be fatal.
 - Think of the Seax as a buffed [Baseball Bat](/weapons/melee/baseball_bat).

## Countering

- As with all melee weapons, the best way to avoid them entirely is to keep your distance and use a gun designed for mid or long-range combat to kill them.
 - Use a high-DPS weapon like the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues) to shoot down the Seax user approaching you if you can't escape.

# Obtaining

The Seax can only be obtained from the [Viking Chest](/obstacles/viking_chest), which always spawns once per game and is located along the shore in the map. 

# Trivia

- The Seax was designed by cobby and 1092384
