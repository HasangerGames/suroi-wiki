**Demo Expert** is a [Perk](/perks) added in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024.   It allows for a greater range with [Throwables](/throwables), as well as providing a precise aiming point.

# Effects
- Grenades can be thrown 2x as far
- 25% of your [Backpack's](/equipment/backpacks) capacity is restocked every 10 seconds with grenades (currently disabled)

Ability to see where your grenades will explode.

# Obtaining 
In Harvest Mode, Demo Expert drops from the [Plumpkin](/obstacles/plumpkin), located in the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta). Like other perks, it is occasionally dropped from [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops) and more commonly from [Gold Airdrops](/obstacles/gold_airdrop_crate).

# Strategies
## Using
- (Obviously) make sure that you carry plenty of Throwables, especially [Frag Grenades](/throwables/frag_grenade).
- Stay out in the open, as this is where Demo Expert is the most powerful.
- During Halloween Mode, [Plumpkin Bomb](/perks/plumpkin_bomb) works very well with Demo Expert, by providing a damage boost and obstacles you can explode.

## Countering
- If you suspect an opponent has Demo Expert, get behind an [Obstacle](/obstacles) as soon as you can. Anything is better than nothing, but preferably one that can block grenades.
    - Buildings are an even safer bet.
- Going inside a [Building](/building) or Bunker makes Demo Expert much less effective.
- If you prefer a more risky approach, you can try and rush them with a CQC weapon like a shotgun, thereby denying them the chance to use their grenades.
