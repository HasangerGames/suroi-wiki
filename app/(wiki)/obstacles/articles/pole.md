The **Pole** is a small circular [Obstacle](/obstacles) that spawns on the Harvest and Halloween Maps and was added in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024.

# Location & Spawning

Poles spawn in all [Tents](/buildings/tents) and [Hay Sheds](/buildings/hay_sheds). Normally there are 1 or 2 per building.

# Loot & More

Poles do not yield loot, but if destroyed, they will collapse the building and all other poles inside it.

# Trivia

- The number of poles you have to destroy to collapse the building varies between [Tents](/buildings/tents) and [Hay Sheds](/buildings/hay_sheds).
