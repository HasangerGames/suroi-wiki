# Piano  
The **Piano** is an indestructible object added in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) “High-Caliber Negotiations” update on September 22, 2024. It is an obstacle designed to add fun and interactivity with the [Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters).  

# Location & Spawning  
Currently, only **1 Piano** spawns per map in the [Headquarters 2nd Floor](/buildings/headquarters_second_floor) next to the [HQ Vault](/buildings/headquarters_vault).  

# Loot & More  
Since the Piano is indestructible, it drops no loot. However, it can be interacted with—if a player hits the Piano with their [Fists](/weapons/melees/fists), the Piano will play odd-sounding chords.  

# Tips  
- Don’t attempt to use the Piano as cover—its positioning doesn’t allow you to manipulate its indestructibility.  
- If another suroian is playing the Piano, join in with them—but surprise them by using a CQC weapon to quickly obliterate them.  
- The Piano can also be played alongside the [Speaker](/obstacles/speaker) to add to the ‘atmosphere’ of the HQ.  

# Trivia  
- Surviv also featured a piano in a different form, and its properties—such as the strange chords played when hit—were incorporated here.
- Platonthek designed the Piano.
