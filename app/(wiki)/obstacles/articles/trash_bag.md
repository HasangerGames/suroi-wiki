The **Trash Bag** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) "High-Caliber Negotiations" update on September 22nd, 2024.

# Location & Spawning

- Two Trash Bags always spawn inside the [Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters); one spawns inside of the vault near the stairwell and another spawns right outside one of the side doors.

- A Trash Bag has a 3 in 8 chance to spawn on the outside of the [Blue House](/buildings/blue_house) instead of a [Box](/obstacles/box).

- A Trash Bag always spawns on the front porch of the [Lodge](/buildings/lodge).

# Loot & More

Trash Bags drop ammo or rarely, a soda. See the [Loot Tables](/loot#trash) for the drop chances.

# Tips

- Trash Bags should be broken for ammo, considering their high chance of dropping ammo.
  - This is especially useful if you join late in the round, or if you have a weapon without ammo.
