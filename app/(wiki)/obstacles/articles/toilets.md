**Toilets** are a type of [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.9.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.9.0) "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023.

# Location & Spawning

Ceramic Toilets are found across many structures and can often spawn multiple times in large structures like the [Lodge](/buildings/lodge). In contrast, the Porta Potty Toilet is only found as part of the [Porta Potty](/buildings/porta_potty).

# Loot & More

Unused Toilets usually contain 2-3 healing items but can occasionally contain scopes and guns. Used Toilets have a much higher chance of containing guns as well as having a chance of dropping equipment.

# Tips

- Toilets can be used as cover in certain situations, but it is more worthwhile to break them for loot.
- Toilets often contain the best loot in houses along with the [Fridge](/obstacles/fridge), so it is recommended to loot them first. Some players go as far as to only loot the Fridge and the Toilet and then immediately leave the house in order to not waste time looting the less valuable obstacles.
