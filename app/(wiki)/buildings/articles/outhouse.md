The **Outhouse** is a small building added alongside the Harvest Map in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. 

# Location & Spawning

Up to ten Outhouses spawn randomly across the map on the Harvest and Halloween Maps. One additional Outhouse always spawns at the [Damaged Armory](/buildings/armory).

# Loot & More

The Outhouse spawns with either an unused [Toilet](/obstacles/toilets) or a used one. Both of the toilets have an equal chance to spawn.

# Tips

- The Outhouse is extremely similar to the [Porta Potty](/buildings/porta_potty). It has identical wall health, similar size, and very similar loot tables (used Toilets are slightly more likely to contain equipment such as vests compared to open Porta Potty Toilets).
- Be careful against assault rifles, LMGs, and other weapons with high obstacle DPS when using the Outhouse as cover. The entire Outhouse can easily be shredded in seconds by those weapons.
- The Outhouse is a good place to hide and heal quickly if necessary.
