The **Ice Pick** is a weapon that was added in the [v0.15.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.15.0) "Pulling the Pin" on January 15, 2024 and was made obtainable in the [v0.22.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.16.0) "Cold Steel" update on December 11, 2024.

# Background

An Ice Pick is a metal tool often accompanied by a wooden or rubber handle and is used to carve and chip ice. In the 19th century before refrigerators were invented, people would often use Ice Picks to cut large blocks of ice and store them in basements to stop their food from perishing. Unsurprisingly, Ice Picks have also historically been used as weapons by crime organizations and gangsters in the United States. 

# Obtaining

The Ice Pick can only be obtained on the Winter Map, where it spawns from the [Ice Pick Case](/obstacles/ice_pick_case) located at the [Christmas Camp](/buildings/christmas_camp).

# Strategies 

## Using 

- As a weapon, the Ice Pick is only slightly better than [Fists](/weapons/melee/fists). 
  - The cooldown of this weapon is higher than average so make sure to time your swings well.
  - It is recommended to swap out this weapon for higher tier melee weapons such as the [Maul](/weapons/melee/maul), which is often considered a direct upgrade of the Ice Pick.
- The Ice Pick's main strengths are the piercing damage and ice damage it provides. This allows the Ice Pick to break impenetrable obstacles such as [Ammo Crates](/obstacles/ammo_crate) and frozen obstacles such as [Frozen Crates](/obstacles/frozen_crate).

## Countering 

- Don't be afraid of getting into a fight with an Ice Pick user due to its low DPS and single shot damage. 
  - Most melee weapons can comfortably win a fight against the Ice Pick.
