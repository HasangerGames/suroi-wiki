- Removes the player's ability to use guns, melee weapons, and grenades
- Grants players Werewolf skin

# Obtaining
Lycanthropy can be obtained from [Plumpkin Gamble](/perks/lets_go_gambling) which drops from [Diseased Plumpkins](/obstacles/diseased_plumpkin).

# Strategies
## Using
- While having Lycanthropy, try to approach players whenever possible and kill them with [Fists](/weapons/melee/fists).
- Do not try to rush toward a player in a straight line, strafe, and make use of your opponent's reloading guns to kill.
- It's best to use Lycanthropy with [Berserker](/perks/stark_melee_gauntlet) as it is extremely deadly to opponents.

## Countering
- When a player with Lycanthropy rushes toward you, it's better not to keep using long-range weapons, switch to shotguns or melee immediately.
- Make sure to keep an eye on Lycanthropy players when they are around, especially when you are fighting another player.
