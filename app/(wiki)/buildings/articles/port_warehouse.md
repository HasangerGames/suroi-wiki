The **Port Warehouse** is a medium-sized sub-building of the [Port](/buildings/port). It was added in the [v0.11.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.11.0) "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023. Crane Warehouses contain a decent amount of loot for the early game from crates and boxes.

# Location & Spawning

Two Port Warehouses spawn parallel to each other in one corner of the port, farthest from the ocean.

# Loot & More

The Port Warehouse contains a bunch of [Regular Crates](/obstacles/regular_crate), [Barrels](/obstacles/barrel), and [Boxes](/obstacles/box), some [Forklifts](/obstacles/forklift), and a [Flint Crate](/obstacles/flint_crate) in one corner.

# Tips

- Be careful of the Barrels inside the Port Warehouse, as an opponent could destroy them when you are distracted and kill you.
- The most valuable loot in the Port Warehouse is arguably the [Flint Crate](/obstacles/flint_crate) in one of the corners, so aim for that first.
- Use the Forklifts as cover against opponents.
- If you spawn late in a game and are certain you won't be first to the [Ship](/buildings/ship), it may be wise to get geared up in a Port Warehouse and then confront the player(s) on the Ship.

# Trivia

- The Port Warehouse was designed by platonthek.
- As of the latest version, there is a small hole in the hitbox of the Port Warehouse that allows you to see inside from the outside wall.
