The **Hay Shed** is a small building added in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) “Open Season” update on October 27, 2024. It only spawns on the Harvest and Halloween maps.

# Location & Spawning
Hay Sheds are scattered around the Harvest and Halloween maps, with one variation of Hay Shed leading to the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker). 

# Loot & More
Hay Shed variation 1 has good loot, with a [Flint Crate](/obstacles/flint_crate). Other variations have less in terms of loot, so don’t necessarily go to a Hay Shed if other loot sources are available. All Hay Sheds have either a [Barrel](/obstacles/barrel) or a [Super Barrel](/obstacles/super_barrel).

# Tips
- Since all Hay Sheds have a barrel of some sort, if you ever notice a player in the Hay Shed, simply shoot the barrel. This trick is especially effective with [Super Barrels](/obstacles/super_barrel).
- Every Hay Shed is a good source of cover, as they all contain a [Hay Bale](/obstacles/hay_bale) or two. Hay Bales have an astounding 180 HP, making excellent bullet-blockers. 
- If you’re looting a Hay Shed, specially one with a Super Barrel, ensure that no more than two [Poles](/obstacles/poles) are broken. If so, the roof will collapse and other players can see you. 
- Hay Shed variant 4 has a stairwell leading to the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker). Keep an eye out for it, as the Plumpkin Bunker is incredibly loot-dense. 
- Use the holes in the roofs of Hay Sheds to find a possible easy kill. 

# Trivia

- The Hay Shed is the first building to have a variation that leads to a bunker
