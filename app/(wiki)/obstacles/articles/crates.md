Crates are a type of obstacle that spawns around the map randomly. They come in three distinct variants with different loot. Regular crates were first added to the game in the [v0.1.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.1.0) "We're back, baby" update on May 20th, 2023. Later, update v0.5.0 "Locked & Loaded" brought the other crate variants.

# Location and Spawning

Crates are generally very common and spawn frequently out in the open. Crates and their variants can also be found inside some buildings.

The Regular Crate is the most common type of crate. Grenade Crates are fairly common, but less common compared to Regular Crates. The AEGIS and Flint crates are rarer. Only five AEGIS crates and five Flint crates spawn per map outside of structures. A single melee crate always spawns per map.

Regular Crates and the Melee Crate are visible on the minimap, but AEGIS and Flint crates are not.

# Loot & More

All crates drop some sort of loot. The Regular Crate drops the [lowest quality loot](/loot#regular_crate), while the [AEGIS](#aegis_crate) and [Flint](#flint_crate) crates drop better loot. [Grenade Crates](#grenade_crate) always drop 3-4 pairs of one of the two grenade types. [Melee crates](/loot#melee_crate) always drop two melee weapons per crate. It can drop either the [Baseball Bat](/weapons/melee/baseball_bat) or the [K-bar](/weapons/melee/kbar). The Baseball Bat is the more common drop.

# Tips

- Regular Crates are very common, so you can usually find one if you need loot.
- Try to go for the AEGIS and Flint crates first, as they almost always drop better loot.
  - However, AEGIS and Flint crates do not reveal their locations on the map.
- Crates can provide limited cover in a pinch, however, they are easily destroyed with any type of weapon.

# Trivia

- Crates were amongst the first obstacles added to the game.
