The PP-19-01 Vityaz is a 9x19mm submachine gun developed in 2004 by a Russian small arms manufacturer Izhmash. It is based on the AK-74 and offers a high degree of parts commonality with the AK-74. The gun is directly developed from the PP-19 Bizon. "Vityaz" (витязь) is Russian for "brave warrior" or "knight". Learn more about the PP-19 [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PP-19-01_Vityaz).

# Strategies

## Using
- The PP-19 consumes lots of ammo, so make sure to stock up on as much 9mm ammunition as you can.
- Using this weapon is very similar to using the [Vector](/weapons/guns/vector), so use it as you would use a vector.
- The big difference is that the PP-19 has much more range for the bullets, so it can be used as a medium-ranged weapons.
- One of the most effective ways to use this, is to get close to your opponent to make sure they get hit with as many bullets as possible.

## Countering
- Hide behind indestructible [Obstacles](/obstacles), unless you have good armor and high damage weapons.
- When the opponent is reloading, take the opportunity and get a few shots at them, this will lower their health and make them unable to defend themselves.
- An effective measure is to have your opponent waste their ammo so that they have to use other weapons.
- Getting into the open when your opponent has a PP-19 might get you killed, but if it happens, try and strafe as many bullets as you can.

# Obtaining
The PP-19 is only found in [Gold Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops) and [Flint Stones](/obstacles/flint_stone).

# Trivia
