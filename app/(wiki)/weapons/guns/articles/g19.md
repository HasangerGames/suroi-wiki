The **Glock 19**, known in-game as the G19, is a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. It was added to the game in the [v0.4.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.4.0) "Supplies received" update on June 17th, 2023.

# Background

The Glock 19 is a "Compact" version of the Glock 17. It carries fifteen rounds in comparison to the Glock 17's seventeen rounds. The Glock series was the first commercially successful polymer-framed pistol. It is famed for its reliability and low cost. Glock variants are in use all over the globe in police, military, and other security forces.

# Strategies

## Using

- Due to the G19's low accuracy, try and get close to your opponent so you can hit your shots.
- Spam click the G19 to achieve the maximum DPS.
  - The G19 can be an effective tool early game against players with no armor or weaker Level 1 [Armor](/equipment/armor).
- It is not recommended that you keep the G19 once you find a better alternative.
- Dual G19s have much more capacity and firepower, especially on mobile.
  - However, they have much worse accuracy than a single G19.
  - Other dual pistols and common weapons like the [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi) are better choices.

## Countering

- Due to the G19 having low stats, it is relatively easy to counter. Stay at a medium distance and gun them down with an assault rifle or rush them with a higher-DPS gun such as an SMG or a shotgun.

# Obtaining

The G19 is a very common weapon that can be found almost anywhere. It usually spawns from low-tier loot sources such as [Regular Crates](/obstacles/regular_crate).

# Trivia

- The G19 is named "G19" instead of "Glock 19" due to copyright concerns.
- Before [v0.9.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.9.0), the G19 was fully automatic instead of semi-automatic, as it is in real-life.
  - This would imply that it had a "switch" on it.
