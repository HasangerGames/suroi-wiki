**Infinite Ammo** is a [Perk](/perks) added in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) "Open Season" update on October 27th, 2024. As the name implies, player have infinite ammo and can empty and reload without affecting the ammo stored in their [Backpack](/equipment/backpacks).

# Effects
All weapons will not use ammo stored in Backpacks when reloaded, allowing for an infinite amount of rounds
  - There is a limit of 3 when using a [Radio](/weapons/guns/radio)


# Obtaining
In Harvest Mode, Infinite Ammo drops from the [Plumpkin](/obstacles/plumpkin), located in the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta). Like other perks, it is occasionally dropped from [Airdrops](/obstacles/airdrops) and more commonly from [Gold Airdrops](/obstacles/gold_airdrop_crate).

# Strategies
## Using
- Infinite Ammo is great with team modes such as Duos and Squads, as you can give your teammates your ammo while also using your [Backpack](/equipment/backpacks) to hold extra ammunition for them.
- You can spray as much as you want, since you won't run out of ammunition.
- Try and get weapons that use rarer ammunition such as .50 Cal or .338 Lapua Magnum, as Infinite Ammo allows you to use these as much as you want without fear of running out.

## Countering
- Because your opponent can destroy cover and never run out of ammo, avoid being out in the open.
  - Go into a [Building](/buildings) or bunker, and make sure to have a CQC weapon such as a shotgun.
  - Rush them with a high DPS weapon.
- Put pressure on your opponent and try to eliminate them fast. Infinite Ammo succeeds in drawn-out engagements where your own ammo stocks might be running low.
- Keep in mind that Infinite Ammo does not actually increase any stats besides allowing your opponent to continuously reload, so you might be able to out-damage them if you have better guns or a different [Perk](/perks) that boosts your damage.
