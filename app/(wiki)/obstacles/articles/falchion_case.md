The **Falchion Case** is an obstacle added in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) “High-Caliber Negotiations” update on September 22nd, 2024. 

# Location & Spawning  

The Falchion Case can be found in the Meeting Room on the second floor of the [AEGIS Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters). 

# Loot & More  

As the name suggests, the Falchion Case drops the [Falchion](/weapons/melee/falchion).

# Tips  

- Although the Falchion is quite a powerful melee, it should not be as high of a priority as getting a gun.   
  - Ideally, you should loot the [Golden Aegis Case](/obstacles/aegis_golden_case) first to get your hands on a solid weapon.
