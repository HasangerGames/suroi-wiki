The **Dumpster** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) "High-Caliber Negotiations" update on September 22nd, 2024.

# Location & Spawning

Dumpsters spawn in the [Port](/buildings/port_meta), inside the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta) and outside the [Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters).

# Loot & More

Dumpsters can drop guns, healing items, scopes, and equipment.

# Tips

- Dumpsters can be used as cover in certain situations and are very effective at doing so due to their high health and ability to ricochet bullets.
  - However, such situations are uncommon due to the positioning of Dumpsters.
- Dumpsters can drop decent loot, although most people don't break them because of their high health.
  - If crates or other loot are nearby, you should break those instead to get loot faster.
  - Conversely, if there isn't any other loot nearby, breaking a dumpster can give you helpful loot.
- Dumpsters reflect bullets, so you can use this to ricochet bullets towards enemies.
