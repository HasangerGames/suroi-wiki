The **Small Bunker** is a bunker that was added in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) "High Caliber Negotiations" update on September 22nd, 2024. 

# Location & Spawning

The Small Bunker is located underground as it is a bunker and can generate anywhere on the map.

The only entrance to the Small Bunker is in the middle of four closely packed [Trees](/obstacles/trees) which can either be oak or birch trees.

# Areas

The only area of the Small Bunker is the main room, which contains a [Small Desk](/obstacles/small_desk), a [Control Panel](/obstacles/control_panel) (always the second variant), two [Boxes](/obstacles/box), two [Small Drawers](/obstacles/drawers), a [Fridge](/obstacles/fridge), a [Crate](/obstacles/crates), and a [Small Bed](/obstaces/small_bed).

# Loot & More

Most of the obstacles that generate inside of the Small Bunker can be broken to get loot except for the Small Bed and the Wall, which drop nothing and the Control Panel, which also explodes along with not dropping loot.

# Tips

- Due to how hard this structure can be to spot and the mediocre loot that it contains, it is usually not worth searching for this structure and looting it unless you come across it accidentally.
- The metal walls and [Metal Door](/obstacles/doors) reflect bullets, so this can be used to your advantage but may also kill you if you aren't careful.
- The Control Panel can explode and deal heavy damage, so make sure to keep distance from it when fighting other players.
