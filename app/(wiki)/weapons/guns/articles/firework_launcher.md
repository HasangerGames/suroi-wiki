The **Firework Launcher** is an RPG utilizing firework ammunition. It was added to the game in the v0.18.0 "Back in the Saddle" update on July 8th, 2024. It shoots very slow, but has a high spread and damage. 

# Strategies

## Using

- The Firework Launcher is viable throughout the game due to its versatility.
  - The [Firework Warehouse](/buildings/firework_warehouse) is majorly contested in the beginning of the game due to it having the Firework Launcher, Fireworks, and [Confetti Grenades](/weapons/throwables/confetti_grenade).
- Make sure to pick up as much Firework ammunition as you can, as it will be hard to source more fireworks later in game.
  - If you are really running low on Fireworks, you can break [Ammo Crates](/obstacles/ammo_crate) using a [Maul](/weapons/melee/maul) to get extra fireworks.
- The Firework Launcher is most effective in long range fights.
  - It pairs very well with larger scopes, like the 8x and 15x.
- Make note that the Fireworks, shot out of the Firework Launcher move relatively slow, so make sure to lead your opponents when you fire.
- The Firework Launcher can also damage yourself, so make sure that there are no obstructions in the firing path.

## Countering

- Weapons such as shotguns or other SMGs overpower the Firework Launcher at close range.
- Stay at close range, because the Firework Launcher is not very good at CQC (Close Quarters Combat).
- Stay aware of opponents with the Firework Launcher and if you are fired upon, you may have time to move out of the way and dodge the firework.

# Obtaining

- The Firework Launcher is one of the rarest weapons in the game, with only one found in every match. It can be found in the [Firework Warehouse](/buildings/firework_warehouse) with ammo.
