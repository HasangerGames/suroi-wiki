The **Crane** is a sub-building of the [Port](/buildings/port). It was added in the [v0.11.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.11.0) "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023. The crane is a good source of cover and can also be used to surprise players.

# Location & Spawning

The Crane always spawns parallel to the [Ship](/buildings/ship), and only one spawns per map.

# Loot & More

The Crane itself does not have any loot, but it does have a large number of [AEGIS](/obstacles/aegis_crate) and [Flint Crates](/obstacles/flint_crate) underneath it, which are great sources of loot.

# Tips

- The parts of the base of the crane are indestructible and can be used to take cover from opponents.
  - If you get caught fighting around the crane, it is best to have a shotgun or SMG.
- The ends of the parts of the base of the crane have a gap that is just wide enough for players.
  - Use this gap to your advantage when fighting opponents at close range.

# Trivia

- The Crane was designed by platonthek.
- The Crane is used to load and unload cargo off of the Ship.
