# Strategies

## Using

- Try to get up close to your opponent without losing too much health, then spam left click when you are close enough to your opponent.
  - Beware if they have a gun designed for close-range combat, such as the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues).
- Using any melee weapon requires good reaction time, as your opponent can escape your attack if they suddenly change directions.

## Countering

- If you see a player who has a K-Bar and is interested in attacking you with it, stay at a distance and gun them down.
  - You can also attempt to rush in with a high-DPS close-range weapon or another melee weapon, although this is risky if the K-Bar user is skilled.

# Obtaining

The K-Bar can be obtained rarely from crates or other common loot sources. Additionally, it has a 75% chance of spawning in the melee crate that spawns once per map.

# Trivia

- The K-Bar was designed by Radians
- The K-Bar is also known as the Ka-bar
- The name comes from a letter in 1923 received from a fur trapper who had used a knife he bought from Union Cutlery Co. to kill a wounded bear that was attacking him and his rifle was jammed. The partially legible letter had the phrase "ka bar" on it, as part of "kill a bear". The KA-BAR name was stamped onto many different knives, and Union Cutlery changed its name to Ka-Bar Cutlery Inc. in 1952
- The steel used in the K-bar has a hardness of 56-58 on the Hardness Rockwell C Scale
