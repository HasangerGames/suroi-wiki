The **Ithaca Gun Company Flues Double-Barrel Trap**, known in-game as the **Flues**, is a double-barrel shotgun utilizing 12-gauge ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.12.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.12.0) "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023.

# Background

The Flues gets its name from designer Emil Flues, who worked for the Ithaca Gun Company from approximately 1906 to 1915. It had a reliable design and was easy to cock with a short hammer fall. About 223,000 were made between 1908 and 1926, in a variety of gauges.

# Strategies

## Using
- The Flues can only hold two rounds, so if you only have 1 loaded, make sure to reload as soon as you can.
  - Take cover if reloading in the middle of a fight.
- If you hit both shots, it will kill or seriously weaken an opponent. Carry a secondary weapon to finish them off.
- Have a long-range weapon as your secondary to balance out the Flues' short range.
- Camp in entrances to [Buildings](/buildings) or in [Bushes](/obstacles/bush) to ambush enemies.
- Be very careful with your shots, as the long reload time and 2 rounds make the Flues unforgiving.
- The Flues is very dangerous when the safe zone is very small or in tight spaces such as Buildings.
- You can use two Flues' as a makeshift [Vepr-12](/weapons/guns/vepr12).
- Because of its very low recoil value and duration, it is not necessary to quickswitch the Flues.

## Countering
- The Flues has the shortest range of any shotgun, tied with the [HP18](/weapons/guns/hp18), so don't get too close.
  - Use a longer-range weapon, such as an assault rifle or DMR.
- If the Flues user fires both of their shots, take advantage of the long reload time and attack while they are vulnerable.
- Depending on the opponent's skill, they may miss one or both of their shots. Strafe them and try to make them miss, then attack while they reload.
- Be wary of [Bushes](/obstacles/bush) and entrances to Buildings if you suspect someone is camping.

# Obtaining

The Flues is currently the second-rarest shotgun in the game. It is about 5 times as rare as the [M3K](/weapons/guns/m3k) and the same level of rarity as the [ARX-160](/weapons/guns/arx160) in normal mode. The Flues can be rarely found as world loot, but it is more common in higher-tier places such as [Flint](/obstacles/flint_crate) and [AEGIS Crates](/obstacles/aegis_crate).

# Trivia

- The real-life Flues was offered in both double and single-barrel variants.
- The reference image for the Flues' icon is based on a 1913 double-barrel.
  - The in-game Flues has its barrel sawn off.
