The **Fence** is a destructible obstacle added in the [v0.15.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.15.0) "Pulling the Pin" update.

# Location & Spawning

Fences surround most of the [Port](/buildings/port) and [Armory](/buildings/armory_meta). Several fences can also be found in the Warehouse of the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta).

# Loot & More

Fences do not drop loot.

# Tips

- Fences can become a deadly trap if you aren't careful in the Port and Armory as they can trap you in a narrow area without any cover. However, they are also extremely easy to break, so there is usually enough time to escape the narrow area by breaking a hole in the Fence. 
- Fences shouldn't be used as cover because they break almost instantly after being hit by bullets.
