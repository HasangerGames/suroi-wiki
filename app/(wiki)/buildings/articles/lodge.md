# Tips

- The Lodge is extremely loot dense, containing a large amount of lootable obstacles as well as the [M590M Gun Mount](/obstacles/gun_mounts). Therefore, it often attracts many players. If you do not have a gun and you spawn in late, then it is advised not to enter this structure.
- The Fireplace in the Lodge is supposed to deal a lot more damage than it actually does in-game; this is the result of a bug with layers.
- Many players are not aware of the M590M Gun Mount that spawns in the Secret Room, so sometimes you can find a Lodge with everything looted but the Secret Room.
- If you spawn near this structure in the early stages of the game, immediately try to get the M590M from the second floor as it is most likely the best piece of loot obtainable from the Lodge.
  - After getting the M590M you can proceed to loot the rest of the structure. Ideally, loot the Upstairs Bathroom or the Fridge in the Kitchen to instantly get some adrenaline items.
  - Alternatively, if you aren't confident in your skill, leave the building as soon as you get the M590M to not attract too much attention and risk getting killed.
- If an enemy player beat you to the M590M, remember that you can use the indestructible walls of the Lodge to your advantage.
  - To do this, hide behind a wall with a high DPS shotgun like the [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues), [HP-18](/weapons/guns/hp18), or even a [DT-11](/weapons/guns/dt11) and wait for the M590M to get close enough for you to surprise them with your weapon. This is because the M590M, similar to the [Model 37](/weapons/guns/model_37) has a very long firing delay.
  - The Flues is the optimal weapon for doing this due to its potential to wipe out an opponent before they can even react.
  - The HP-18 can be almost as effective but may require at least 3 direct hits due to its lower damage compared to the Flues.
  - This strategy may not as work as well with the DT-11 due to its lower damage output than the Flues and lower capacity compared to the HP-18.
  - Do not try this with the Model 37 as it has a long firing delay, making it extremely risky to use against the M590M.
