The **Port** is a very large structure added in the [v0.11.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.11.0) "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023. It has a number of buildings and containers and is also the home of the [Cargo Ship](/buildings/cargo_ship) and the [Oil Tanker](/buildings/oil_tanker).

# Location & Spawning

One Port attempts to spawn per map, always at the edge of the map. However, a Port can fail to spawn on a map in very rare circumstances.

# Areas
## Entrance
The Entrance to the Port contains a [Barrier](/obstacles/barrier) with a [Shed](/buildings/shed) next to it. Adjacent to the Shed is a [Porta Potty](/buildings/porta_potty).

## Port Warehouses
Two Port Warehouses spawn at opposite sides of the Port. They are special variants of the [Warehouse](/buildings/warehouse) that have a different layout and roof design. All Port Warehouses contain the following:

- A [Flint Crate](/obstacles/crates) near a [Regular Crate](/obstacles/crates), a [Super Barrel](/obstacles/super_barrel), and two [Barrels](/obstacles/barrel) at one end of the building. The Flint Crate is sometimes replaced by a regular crate.
- A [Forklift](/obstacles/forklift) with three Regular Crates behind it and two Barrels with two [Boxes](/obstacles/box) near them at the center of the building.
- A Forklift, a Super Barrel, and a Regular Crate at the other end of the building.

One of the Port Warehouses is colored blue while the other is colored red. Two [Dumpsters](/obstacles/dumpster), a Flint Crate that is sometimes replaced with a Regular Crate, and a Forklift with a Flint Crate can be found on the outside of the Blue Port Warehouse.

## Containers
Four groups of six [Containers](/buildings/containers) can be found scattered throughout the Port. These Containers are usually the blue, green, and yellow Containers found scattered around the map but can also be silver or red, which are container colors exclusive to the Port. Silver and red Containers are inaccessible and never have any openings.

One group of Containers spawns inland of the Blue Port Warehouse, two groups can be found in the center of the Port, and one group can be found underneath the Crane at the far end of the Port. The group of Containers found near the Blue Port Warehouse also has a Barrel and a Super Barrel near it as well as several crates which can be [AEGIS Crates](/obstacles/crates), Flint Crates, Normal Crates, or Grenade Crates.

## Parking Lot
The Parking Lot can be found at the far end of the Port near the Crane. It contains two [Trucks](/obstacles/trucks) that both have [Trailers](/obstacles/trailer) attached to them, two Forklifts with one having a Barrel and the other having a Regular Crate, three Boxes, and three Regular Crates. One of the Regular Crates is sometimes replaced with a [Grenade Crate](/obstacles/grenade_crate). 

## Crane
The Crane can be found at the far end of the Port next to the Parking Lot. A group of Containers and two Barrels that are sometimes replaced by Super Barrels can be found right underneath the Crane. A Porta Potty, two Regular Crates, two AEGIS Crates, a Forklift with a Regular Crate and Box, and a Grenade Crate can also be found nearby.

## Secret Area
Next to the Porta Potty near the Shed and inland of the Red Port Warehouse is the the Secret Area. It contains three [Sandbags](/obstacles/sandbags), three Barrels, two Super Barrels, and two crates which can either be Flint Crates or AEGIS Crates. 

## Ship
The Ship can be found offshore of the Port and is connected to the Port through two walkways near the Crane. There are two types of ships that both have an equal chance of spawning: the [Cargo Ship](/buildings/cargo_ship) and the [Oil Tanker](/buildings/oil_tanker).

# Tips

## Looting the Port
- The first thing you should go for when entering the Port should be the Flint and Aegis Crates that spawn in the structure as these crate will provide you with basic equipment such as [armor](/equipment/armor) and common [weapons](/weapons). Don't immediately rush for the loot on the Ship as you could easily be ambushed who have more gear than you.
  - One of the best places to start is to break a hole in the [Fence](/obstacles/fence) near the Secret Area as this will instantly give you access to two crates that are either Flint or AEGIS Crates. Just make sure no other players spot you so nobody blows up the Barrels and Super Barrels nearby.
  - If you enter in from the side with the Blue Port Warehouse, you can also start by looting the two AEGIS Crates near the Crane.

  - Depending on your loadout after looting these crates you can either go for the two Flint Crates near the Blue Port Warehouse (one of them is on a Forklift) or head directly for the Ship.

- On the way to the Ship, briefly look inside the Containers and grab anything that might be useful such as a spare weapon or healing items.
- Since the Ships are generally very dangerous since both variants will attact many players due to their high amounts of valuable loot, try to loot them efficiently and not attract too much attention unless you are looking to get more kills.
  - You can do this by only looting the most important area of the Ship which is the [Tango Crate](/obstacles/tango_crate) for the Cargo Ship and the [Briefcase](/obstacles/briefcase) for the Oil Tanker. Note that both crates are locked in vaults and require different puzzles to solve in order to unlock the vault in question. See the individual pages for each Ship variant for more information.
  - If there is time you can loot the rest of the Ship which often has more loot to offer such as AEGIS Crates and a [Fire Hatchet Case](/obstacles/fire_hatchet_case) on the Oil Tanker.
- After looting the Ship, you can either exit the Port or loot the rest of the Port if there's enough time.
