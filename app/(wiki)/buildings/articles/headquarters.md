Inside the Vault, there always spawns two [Boxes](/obstacles/box), two [Gun Locker](/obstacles/gun_locker), and a [Mini-14](/weapons/guns/mini14) on a wall mount. The Gun Lockers are only breakable with an armor-piercing melee weapon.

Next to the Cafeteria and close to the main entrance, there are a large number of cubicles as well as a larger office.

## Second Floor
On the second floor of the Headquarters, you can find an Executive Office, a Lounge with a [Piano](/obstacles/piano) and a [Speaker](/obstacles/speaker), and a Boardroom containing the [Falchion](/weapons/melee/falchion). There is also a Secret Room accessible from both the Lounge Room and the Executive Office. 

### Boardroom

The first is by breaking the [Filing Cabinet](/obstacles/filing_cabinet) in the Executive Office, and the second is by breaking the couch in the Lounge. Inside the Secret Room is the [Golden AEGIS Case](/obstacles/aegis_golden_case).

# Tips
- As the game's currently largest single building in normal mode, the Headquarters usually had a lot of players converging on it.
- The Headquarters includes a lot of areas suitable for CQC weapons like SMGs and shotguns.
 - LMGs can be useful in certain areas such as the cubicles for destroying cover.
- If you hear the music from upstairs, there's a good chance the Golden AEGIS Case has already been looted.
- Try to get weapons before entering the Headquarters, to defend yourself better.
- If you come through the main entrance, going into the Security Office's Armory can be a good option to quickly get a decent gun or two and some supplies.
- Players entering from the inside staircase may want to loot the Boardroom first, as it contains a lot of loot as well as the Falchion, before tackling the Secret Room.
- If you're entering on the outside staircase, your best bet is to get into the Secret Room through the couch.
- The Metal Detectors can be very useful for letting you know when players have entered/exited the building even if you haven't seen them.
  - You can place [C4](/weapons/throwables/c4) under the Metal Detectors to try and catch unsuspecting players. Simply trigger it when you hear the beep.
- "The pass" (where food is taken from kitchen to the table), or the area between the Cafeteria's kitchen and the rest of the Cafeteria, can be fired through with guns as it is a gap in the wall. Many players don't realize this and think they are safe behind this "wall".
