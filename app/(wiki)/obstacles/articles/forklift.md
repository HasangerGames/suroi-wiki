The **Forklift** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.11.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.11.0) "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023.

# Location & Spawning

The Forklift always spawns inside [Port Warehouses](/buildings/port_warehouse) as well as around the rest of the [Port](/buildings/port). A single Forklift can also be found in the warehouse of the [Plumpkin Bunker](/buildings/plumpkin_bunker_meta).

# Loot & More

The Forklift itself is indestructible and drops no loot. However, it often has a [Pallet](/obstacles/pallet) on the forks of it, which can often have lootable obstacles such as [Boxes](/obstacles/boxes).

# Tips

- Being indestructible, the Forklift is a pretty decent source of cover.
- Move around it to frustrate your opponents.
