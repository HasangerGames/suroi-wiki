The **Sea Traffic Control** is a building added in the [v0.16.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.16.0) update "A Sailor's Dream" on February 26th, 2024.

# Location & Spawning

The Sea Traffic Control structure is located in every game on the shore of the map in a random location.

## Entrance
The entrance to the sea traffic control is guarded by three [Sandbags](/obstacles/sandbags), two [Barrels](/obstacles/barrel), and a [Crate](/obstacles/crate).

## Interior

Inside, there will be a [Table](/obstacles/table) with an [Office Chair](/obstacles/office_chair), two [Life Preservers](/obstacle/life_preserver), an [Aegis Crate](/obstacles/crate), a [Large Drawer](/obstacles/drawers), [Control Panels](/obstacle/control_panel) with two [Office Chairs](/obstacles/office_chair), and a [Gun Case](/obstacles/gun_case).

# Loot & More

A [Radio](/weapons/guns/radio) spawns on the floor in the interior of every Sea Traffic Control. It can be used to call an [Airdrop](/obstacles/airdrops).

# Tips

- The Radio should be set off as soon as you get hold of it so you can get the Airdrop quicker.
- This will likely draw the attention of nearby players, as Airdrops give off a ping sound when they are deployed on the map.
  - Be prepared to fight off other players trying to steal the Airdrop.
  - You can break the gun case in the Interior and use the gun provided to fight players.
  - The Sandbags can help with this as they provide indestructible cover.
- If you spawn late in the game, going for this structure isn't recommended, as it will likely be looted prior to your visit, especially in crowded lobbies.
- If you see a player looting the Interior, throw several [Frag Grenades](/weapons/throwables/frag_grenade) to chase your opponent out, then shoot them down using your guns.
  - Alternatively, you can also shoot the control panels inside the Interior if you don't have grenades.

# Trivia

- The Tugboats were designed by Platonthek and Emeraldneo.
