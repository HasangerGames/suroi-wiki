**Drawers** are a type of [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the [v0.9.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.9.0) "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023.

# Location & Spawning

Drawers of both sizes spawn throughout the [House](/buildings/house) and the [Small House](/buildings/small_house) as well as in some areas of the [Armory](/buildings/armory). A Small Drawer can be found in the [Mobile Home](/buildings/mobile_home) and a Large Drawer spawns in the Control Room of the [Oil Tanker](/buildings/oil_tanker). Two Small Drawers can also be found in the [Small Bunker](/buildings/small_bunker).

# Loot & More

Small Drawers drop either healing items or ammo while Large Drawers drop guns, scopes, and equipment.

# Tips

- Drawers can be used as cover in some situations, but it is better to break them for loot.
