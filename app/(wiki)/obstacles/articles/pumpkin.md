The **Pumpkin** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) on the Halloween map. It was added to the game in the [v0.12.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.12.0) "Trick-or-Tweak" update on October 29th, 2023. It was a very common obstacle and a main focus of Halloween mode.

# Location & Spawning

75 Pumpkins spawn around the Halloween map in random locations.

# Loot & More

The pumpkin drops one of the following guns: - 95% chance for a [G17 (scoped)](/weapons/guns/s_g17). - 5% chance for a [USAS-12](/weapons/guns/usas12).

# Tips

- The small size and low health of the Pumpkin make it a poor choice for cover.
- Try and break as many Pumpkins as you can early game to try and get the USAS-12.
