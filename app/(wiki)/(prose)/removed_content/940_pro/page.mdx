# 940 Pro

The **Mossberg 940 JM Pro**, known in-game as the **940 Pro**, was a common semi-automatic shotgun firing 12-gauge ammunition. It was added to the game in the [v0.5.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.5.0) "Locked & Loaded" update on June 24th, 2023 and removed in the [v0.7.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.7.0) "Geared Up" update on July 9th, 2023 after being replaced by the [HP18](/weapons/guns/hp18).

# Background
The Mossberg 940 JM Pro was an improved version of the Mossberg 930. Several internal changes were done to the Mossberg 930 to make it more reliable as some people complained about having to clean it too much. The Mossberg 940 JM Pro solved most of these issues, allowing people to clean their guns less frequently.

# Trivia

- The 940 Pro was removed and replaced with the HP18 because the developers thought the loot image was too similar to other shotguns such as the [M3K](/weapons/guns/m3k).
