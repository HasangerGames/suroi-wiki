# Loot Barrel

Loot barrels are a type of obstacle added in the v.18.2 update on July 4th, 2024. 

# Location & Spawning

Loot barrels are bluish-gray and only 1 spawns per map. No loot barrels are found in structures. 

# Loot & More

Loot barrels, as the name indicates, drop 1 [SR-25](/weapons/guns/sr25) with ammo, a backpack or vest, a [Crowbar](/weapons/melees/crowbar), and 3 [Throwables](/weapons#throwables). However, the barrel does explode once broken, damaging nearby obstacles as well as players if they are close by. 

# Tips

- You can gun down or destroy this barrel if other players are close by, but this is not recommended due to the good loot that it drops once broken. 
- Ideally this barrel should not be used for cover from enemies due to the damage dealt as well as the loot it drops.
- Gun down this barrel from a distance to ensure that you don't deal damage to yourself while trying to get the drop.

# Trivia

- The loot barrel has a different marking on the yellow caution sign, use this to help identify it.
- The loot barrel is the third cache added to the game (the other two are the [Loot Tree](/obstacles/loot_tree) and the [Gold Rock](/obstacles/gold_rock).
